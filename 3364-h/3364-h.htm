    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Near the verge of a bold promontory stands the hotel, and looks
      southeastward over a sweep of sea unbroken to the horizon. Behind it
      stretches the vast forest, which after two hundred years has resumed the
      sterile coast wrested from it by the first Pilgrims, and has begun to
      efface the evidences of the inroad made in recent years by the bold
      speculator for whom Jocelyn's is named. The young birches and spruces are
      breast high in the drives and avenues at Jocelyn's; the low blackberry
      vines and the sweet fern cover the carefully-graded sidewalks, and obscure
      the divisions of the lots; the children of the boarders have found
      squawberries in the public square on the spot where the band-stand was to
      have been. The notion of a sea-side resort at this point was courageously
      conceived, and to a certain extent it was generously realized. Except for
      its remoteness from the railroad, a drawback which future enterprise might
      be expected to remedy in some way, the place has many natural advantages.
      The broad plateau is cooled by a breeze from the vast forests behind it,
      which comes laden with health and freshness from the young pines; the sea
      at its feet is warmed by the Gulf Stream to a temperature delicious for
      bathing. There are certainly mosquitoes from the woods; but there are
      mosquitoes everywhere, and the report that people have been driven away by
      them is manifestly untrue, for whoever comes to Jocelyn's remains. The
      beach at the foot of the bluff is almost a mile at its curve, and it is so
      smooth and hard that it glistens like polished marble when newly washed by
      the tide. It is true that you reach it from the top by a flight of eighty
      steps, but it was intended to have an elevator, like those near the
      Whirlpool at Niagara. In the mean time it is easy enough to go down, and
      the ladies go down every day, taking their novels or their needle-work
      with them. They have various notions of a bath: some conceive that it is
      bathing to sit in the edge of the water, and emit shrieks as the surge
      sweeps against them; others run boldly in, and after a moment of poignant
      hesitation jump up and down half-a-dozen times, and run out; yet others
      imagine it better to remain immersed to the chin for a given space,
      looking toward the shore with lips tightly shut and the breath held. But
      after the bath they are all of one mind; they lay their shawls on the warm
      sand, and, spreading out their hair to dry, they doze in the sun, in such
      coils and masses as the unconscious figure lends itself to. When they rise
      from their beds, they sit in the shelter of the cliff and knit or sew,
      while one of them reads aloud, and another stands watch to announce the
      coming of the seals, which frequent a reef near the shore in great
      numbers. It has been said at rival points on the coast that the ladies
      linger there in despair of ever being able to remount to the hotel. A
      young man who clambered along the shore from one of those points reported
      finding day after day the same young lady stretched out on the same shawl,
      drying the same yellow hair, who had apparently never gone upstairs since
      the season began. But the recurrence of this phenomenon in this spot at
      the very moment when the young man came by might have been accounted for
      upon other theories. Jocelyn's was so secluded that she could not have
      expected any one to find her there twice, and if she had expected this she
      would not have permitted it. Probably he saw a different young lady each
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the same boarders come year after year, and these tremble at the
      suggestion of a change for the better in Jocelyn's. The landlord has
      always believed that Jocelyn's would come up, some day, when times got
      better. He believes that the narrow-gauge railroad from New Leyden&mdash;arrested
      on paper at the disastrous moment when the fortunes of Jocelyn's felt the
      general crash&mdash;will be pushed through yet; and every summer he
      promises that next summer they are going to have a steam-launch running
      twice a day from Leyden Harbor. But at present his house is visited once a
      day by a barge, as the New England coast-folks call the vehicle in which
      they convey city boarders to and from the station, and the old frequenters
      of the place hope that the station will never be nearer Jocelyn's than at
      present. Some of them are rich enough to afford a sojourn at more
      fashionable resorts; but most of them are not, though they are often
      people of polite tastes and of aesthetic employments. They talk with
      slight of the large watering-places, and probably they would not like
      them, though it is really economy that inspires their passion for
      Jocelyn's with most of them, and they know of the splendid weariness of
      Newport mostly by hearsay. New arrivals are not favored, but there are not
      often new arrivals at Jocelyn's. The chief business of the barge is to
      bring fresh meat for the table and the gaunt bag which contains the mail;
      for in the first flush of the enterprise the place was made a post-office,
      and the landlord is postmaster; he has the help of the lady-boarders in
      his official duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scattered about among the young birches there are several of those pine
      frames known as shells, within easy walk of the hotel, where their inmates
      board. They are picturesque interiors, and are on informal terms with the
      public as to many domestic details. The lady of the house, doing her back
      hair at her dressing-room glass, is divided from her husband, smoking at
      the parlor fire-place, only by a partition of unlathed studding. The
      arrest of development in these shells is characteristic of everything
      about the place. None of the improvements invented since the hard times
      began have been added to Jocelyn's; lawntennis is still unknown there; but
      there is a croquet-ground before the hotel, where the short, tough grass
      is kept in tolerable order. The wickets are pretty rusty, and it is
      usually the children who play; but toward the close of a certain,
      afternoon a young lady was pushing the balls about there. She seemed to be
      going over a game just played, and trying to trace the cause of her
      failure. She made bad shots, and laughed at her blunders. Another young
      lady drooped languidly on a bench at the side of the croquet-ground, and
      followed her movements with indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how you did it, Louise,&rdquo; panted the player; &ldquo;it's astonishing
      how you beat me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady on the bench made as if to answer, but ended by coughing
      hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear child!&rdquo; cried the first, dropping her mallet, and running to
      her. &ldquo;You ought to have put on your shawl!&rdquo; She lifted the knit shawl
      lying beside her on the bench, and laid it across the other's shoulders,
      and drew it close about her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;It chokes me to be bundled up so tight.&rdquo; She
      shrugged the shawl down to her shoulders with a pretty petulance. &ldquo;If my
      chest's protected, that's all that's necessary.&rdquo; But she made no motion to
      drape the outline which her neatly-fitted dress displayed, and she did not
      move from her place, or look up at her anxious friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but don't sit here, Louise,&rdquo; the latter pleaded, lingering near her.
      &ldquo;I was wrong to let you sit down at all after you had got heated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Grace, I had to,&rdquo; said she who was called Louise. &ldquo;I was so tired
      out. I'm not going to take more cold. I can always tell when I am. I'll
      put on the shawl in half a minute; or else I'll go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure there's nothing to keep me out. That's the worst of these lonely
      places: my mind preys upon itself. That's what Dr. Nixon always said: he
      said it was no use in air so long as my mind preyed upon itself. He said
      that I ought to divert my mind all I could, and keep it from preying upon
      itself; that it was worth all the medicine in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's perfectly true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought n't to keep reminding me all the time that I'm sick.
      That's what starts my mind to preying upon itself; and when it gets going
      once I can't stop it. I ought to treat myself just like a well person;
      that's what the doctor said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other stood looking at the speaker in frowning perplexity. She was a
      serious-faced girl, and now when she frowned her black brows met sternly
      above her gray eyes. But she controlled any impulse she had to severity,
      and asked gently, &ldquo;Shall I send Bella to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I can't make society out of a child the whole time. I'll just sit
      here till the barge comes in. I suppose it will be as empty as a gourd, as
      usual.&rdquo; She added, with a sick and weary negligence, &ldquo;I don't even know
      where Bella is. She's run off, somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's quite time she should be looked up, for tea. I'll wander out that
      way and look for her.&rdquo; She indicated the wilderness generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Louise. She now gratefully drew her shawl up over her
      shoulders, and faced about on the bench so as to command an easy view of
      the arriving barge. The other met it on her way to the place in the woods
      where the children usually played, and found it as empty as her friend had
      foreboded. But the driver stopped his horses, and leaned out of the side
      of the wagon with a little package in his hand. He read the
      superscription, and then glanced consciously at the girl. &ldquo;You're Miss
      Breen, ain't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, with lady-like sweetness and a sort of business-like
      alertness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; suggested the driver, &ldquo;this is for Miss Grace Breen, M. D.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me, thank you,&rdquo; said the young lady. &ldquo;I'm Dr. Breen.&rdquo; She put out her
      hand for the little package from the homoeopathic pharmacy in Boston; and
      the driver yielded it with a blush that reddened him to his hair. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
       he said slowly, staring at the handsome girl, who did not visibly share
      his embarrassment, &ldquo;they told me you was the one; but I could n't seem to
      get it through me. I thought it must be the old lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother is Mrs. Breen,&rdquo; the young lady briefly explained, and walked
      rapidly away, leaving the driver stuck in the heavy sand of Sea-Glimpse
      Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, get up!&rdquo; he shouted to his horses. &ldquo;Goin' to stay here all day?&rdquo; He
      craned his neck round the side of the wagon for a sight of her. &ldquo;Well,
      dumm 'f I don't wish I was sick! Steps along,&rdquo; he mused, watching the
      swirl and ripple of her skirt, &ldquo;like&mdash;I dunno what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her face turned from him Dr. Breen blushed, too; she was not yet so
      used to her quality of physician that she could coldly bear the confusion
      to which her being a doctor put men. She laughed a little to herself at
      the helplessness of the driver, confronted probably for the first time
      with a graduate of the New York homoeopathic school; but she believed that
      she had reasons for taking herself seriously in every way, and she had not
      entered upon this career without definite purposes. When she was not yet
      out of her teens, she had an unhappy love affair, which was always darkly
      referred to as a disappointment by people who knew of it at the time.
      Though the particulars of the case do not directly concern this story, it
      may be stated that the recreant lover afterwards married her dearest
      girl-friend, whom he had first met in her company. It was cruel enough,
      and the hurt went deep; but it neither crushed nor hardened her. It
      benumbed her for a time; she sank out of sight; but when she returned to
      the knowledge of the world she showed no mark of the blow except what was
      thought a strange eccentricity in a girl such as she had been. The world
      which had known her&mdash;it was that of an inland New England city&mdash;heard
      of her definitely after several years as a student of medicine in New
      York. Those who had more of her intimacy understood that she had chosen
      this work with the intention of giving her life to it, in the spirit in
      which other women enter convents, or go out to heathen lands; but probably
      this conception had its exaggerations. What was certain was that she was
      rich enough to have no need of her profession as a means of support, and
      that its study had cost her more than the usual suffering that it brings
      to persons of sensitive nerves. Some details were almost insuperably
      repugnant; but in schooling herself to them she believed that she was
      preparing to encounter anything in the application of her science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first intention had been to go back to her own town after her
      graduation, and begin the practice of her profession among those who had
      always known her, and whose scrutiny and criticism would be hardest to
      bear, and therefore, as she fancied, the most useful to her in the
      formation of character. But afterwards she relinquished her purpose in
      favor of a design which she thought would be more useful to others: she
      planned going to one of the great factory towns, and beginning practice
      there, in company with an older physician, among the children of the
      operatives. Pending the completion of this arrangement, which was waiting
      upon the decision of the other lady, she had come to Jocelyn's with her
      mother, and with Mrs. Maynard, who had arrived from the West, aimlessly
      sick and unfriended, just as they were about leaving home. There was no
      resource but to invite her with them, and Dr. Breen was finding her first
      patient in this unexpected guest. She did not wholly regret the accident;
      this, too, was useful work, though not that she would have chosen; but her
      mother, after a fortnight, openly repined, and could not mention Mrs.
      Maynard without some rebellious murmur. She was an old lady, who had once
      kept a very vigilant conscience for herself; but after making her life
      unhappy with it for some threescore years, she now applied it entirely to
      the exasperation and condemnation of others. She especially devoted it to
      fretting a New England girl's naturally morbid sense of duty in her
      daughter, and keeping it in the irritation of perpetual self-question. She
      had never actively opposed her studying medicine; that ambition had
      harmonized very well with certain radical tendencies of her own, and it
      was at least not marriage, which she had found tolerable only in its
      modified form of widowhood; but at every step after the decisive step was
      taken she was beset with misgivings lest Grace was not fully alive to the
      grave responsibilities of her office, which she accumulated upon the girl
      in proportion as she flung off all responsibilities of her own. She was
      doubtless deceived by that show of calm which sometimes deceived Grace
      herself, who, in tutoring her soul to bear what it had to bear, mistook
      her tense effort for spiritual repose, and scarcely realized through her
      tingling nerves the strain she was undergoing. In spite of the bitter
      experience of her life, she was still very ardent in her hopes of
      usefulness, very scornful of distress or discomfort to herself, and a
      little inclined to exact the heroism she was ready to show. She had a
      child's severe morality, and she had hardly learned to understand that
      there is much evil in the world that does not characterize the
      perpetrators: she held herself as strictly to account for every word and
      deed as she held others, and she had an almost passionate desire to meet
      the consequence of her errors; till that was felt, an intolerable doom
      hung over her. She tried not to be impulsive; that was criminal in one of
      her calling; and she struggled for patience with an endeavor that was
      largely successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the effect of her career outside of herself, and of those whom her
      skill was to benefit, she tried to think neither arrogantly nor meanly.
      She would not entertain the vanity that she was serving what is called the
      cause of woman, and she would not assume any duties or responsibilities
      toward it. She thought men were as good as women; at least one man had
      been no worse than one woman; and it was in no representative or exemplary
      character that she had chosen her course. At the same time that she held
      these sane opinions, she believed that she had put away the hopes with the
      pleasures that might once have taken her as a young girl. In regard to
      what had changed the current of her life, she mentally asserted her mere
      nullity, her absolute non-existence. The thought of it no longer rankled,
      and that interest could never be hers again. If it had not been so much
      like affectation, and so counter to her strong aesthetic instinct, she
      might have made her dress somehow significant of her complete abeyance in
      such matters; but as it was she only studied simplicity, and as we have
      seen from the impression of the barge-driver she did not finally escape
      distinction in dress and manner. In fact, she could not have escaped that
      effect if she would; and it was one of the indomitable contradictions of
      her nature that she would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came back to the croquet-ground, leading the little girl by the
      hand, she found Mrs. Maynard no longer alone and no longer sad. She was
      chatting and laughing with a slim young fellow, whose gay blue eyes looked
      out of a sunburnt face, and whose straw hat, carried in his hand, exposed
      a closely shaven head. He wore a suit of gray flannel, and Mrs. Maynard
      explained that he was camping on the beach at Birkman's Cove, and had come
      over in the steamer with her when she returned from Europe. She introduced
      him as Mr. Libby, and said, &ldquo;Oh, Bella, you dirty little thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Libby bowed anxiously to Grace, and turned for refuge to the little
      girl. &ldquo;Hello, Bella!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;Remember me?&rdquo; The child
      put her left hand on that of Grace holding her right, and prettily pressed
      her head against the girl's arm in bashful silence. Grace said some coldly
      civil words to the young man: without looking at Mrs. Maynard, and passed
      on into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean that's your doctor?&rdquo; he scarcely more than whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Maynard. &ldquo;Is n't she too lovely? And she's just
      as good! She used to stand up at school for me, when all the girls were
      down on me because I was Western. And when I came East, this time, I just
      went right straight to her house. I knew she could tell me exactly what to
      do. And that's the reason I'm here. I shall always recommend this air to
      anybody with lung difficulties. It's the greatest thing! I'm almost
      another person. Oh, you need n't look after her, Mr. Libby! There's
      nothing flirtatious about Grace,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maynard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man recovered himself from his absentminded stare in the
      direction Grace had taken, with a frank laugh. &ldquo;So much the better for a
      fellow, I should say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace handed the little girl over to her nurse, and went to her own room,
      where she found her mother waiting to go down to tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Maynard?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Breen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out on the croquet-ground,&rdquo; answered the daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it would be damp,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will come in when the tea-bell rings. She wouldn't come in now, if I
      told her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the elder lady, &ldquo;for a person who lets her doctor pay her
      board, I think 'she's very independent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would n't speak of that, mother,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it, Grace. It's ridiculous,&mdash;that's what it is; it's
      ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see anything ridiculous in it. A physician need not charge
      anything unless he chooses, or she; and if I choose to make Louise my
      guest here it's quite the same as if she were my guest at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like you to have such a guest,&rdquo; said Mrs. Green. &ldquo;I don't see
      what claim she has upon your hospitality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a double claim upon it,&rdquo; Grace answered, with a flush. &ldquo;She is in
      sickness and in trouble. I don't see how she could have a better claim.
      Even if she were quite well I should consider the way she had been treated
      by her husband sufficient, and I should want to do everything I could for
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should want her to behave herself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Breen dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How behave herself? What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Grace, with guilty heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I mean, Grace. A woman in her position ought to be more
      circumspect than any other woman, if she wants people to believe that her
      husband treated her badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought n't to blame her for trying to forget her troubles. It's
      essential to her recovery for her to be as cheerful as she can be. I know
      that she's impulsive, and she's free in her manners with strangers; but I
      suppose that's her Westernism. She's almost distracted. She was crying
      half the night, with her troubles, and kept Bella and me both awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Bella with her now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Grace admitted. &ldquo;Jane's getting her ready to go down with us. Louise
      is talking with a gentleman who came over on the steamer with her; he's
      camping on the beach near here. I didn't wait to hear particulars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the nurse brought the little girl to their door, Mrs. Green took one
      hand and Grace the other, and they led her down to tea. Mrs. Maynard was
      already at table, and told them all about meeting Mr. Libby abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the present time she and Grace had not seen each other since they
      were at school together in Southington, where the girl used to hear so
      much to the disadvantage of her native section that she would hardly have
      owned to it if her accent had not found her out. It would have been
      pleasanter to befriend another person, but the little Westerner suffered a
      veritable persecution, and that was enough to make Grace her friend.
      Shortly after she returned home from school she married, in that casual
      and tentative fashion in which so many marriages seem made. Grace had
      heard of her as travelling in Europe with her husband, from whom she was
      now separated. She reported that he had known Mr. Libby in his bachelor
      days, and that Mr. Libby had travelled with them. Mr. Maynard appeared to
      have left to Mr. Libby the arrangement of his wife's pleasures, the
      supervision of her shopping, and the direction of their common journeys
      and sojourns; and it seemed to have been indifferent to him whether his
      friend was smoking and telling stories with him, or going with his wife to
      the opera, or upon such excursions as he had no taste for. She gave the
      details of the triangular intimacy with a frank unconsciousness; and after
      nine o'clock she returned from a moonlight walk on the beach with Mr.
      Libby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace sat waiting for her at the little one's bedside, for Bella had been
      afraid to go to sleep alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good you are!&rdquo; cried Louise, in a grateful under-tone, as she came
      in. She kissed Grace, and choked down a cough with her hand over her
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise,&rdquo; said Grace sternly, &ldquo;this is shameful! You forget that you are
      married, and ill, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm ever so much better, to-night. The air's just as dry! And you
      needn't mind Mr. Libby. He's such an old friend! Besides, I'm sure to gain
      the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter. Even as a divorced woman, you oughtn't to go on in this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I would n't, with every one. But it's quite different with Mr.
      Libby. And, besides, I have to keep my mind from preying on itself
      somehow.&rdquo;

      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maynard sat in the sun on the seaward-looking piazza of the hotel,
      and coughed in the warm air. She told the ladies, as they came out from
      breakfast, that she was ever so much better generally, but that she seemed
      to have more of that tickling in her throat. Each of them advised her for
      good, and suggested this specific and that; and they all asked her what
      Miss Breen was doing for her cough. Mrs. Maynard replied, between the
      paroxysms, that she did not know: it was some kind of powders. Then they
      said they would think she would want to try something active; even those
      among them who were homoeopathists insinuated a fine distrust of a
      physician of their own sex. &ldquo;Oh, it's nothing serious,&rdquo; Mrs. Maynard
      explained. &ldquo;It's just bronchial. The air will do me more good than
      anything. I'm keeping out in it all I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After they were gone, a queer, gaunt man came and glanced from the doorway
      at her. He had one eye in unnatural fixity, and the other set at that
      abnormal slant which is said to qualify the owner for looking round a
      corner before he gets to it. A droll twist of his mouth seemed partly
      physical, but: there is no doubt that he had often a humorous intention.
      It was Barlow, the man-of-all-work, who killed and plucked the poultry,
      peeled the potatoes and picked the peas, pulled the sweet-corn and the
      tomatoes, kindled the kitchen fire, harnessed the old splayfooted mare,&mdash;safe
      for ladies and children, and intolerable for all others, which formed the
      entire stud of the Jocelyn House stables,&mdash;dug the clams, rowed and
      sailed the boat, looked after the bath-houses, and came in contact with
      the guests at so many points that he was on easy terms with them all. This
      ease tended to an intimacy which he was himself powerless to repress, and
      which, from time to time, required their intervention. He now wore a
      simple costume of shirt and trousers, the latter terminated by a pair of
      broken shoes, and sustained by what he called a single gallows; his
      broad-brimmed straw hat scooped down upon his shoulders behind, and in
      front added to his congenital difficulty of getting people in focus. &ldquo;How
      do you do, this morning, Mrs. Maynard?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm first-rate, Mr. Barlow. What sort of day do you think it's going
      to be for a sail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barlow came out to the edge of the piazza, and looked at the sea and sky.
      &ldquo;First-rate. Fog's most burnt away now. You don't often see a fog at
      Jocelyn's after ten o'clock in the mornin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked for approval to Mrs. Maynard, who said, &ldquo;That's so. The air's
      just splendid. It 's doing everything for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's these pine woods, back o' here. Every breath on 'em does ye good.
      It's the balsam in it. D' you ever try,&rdquo; he asked, stretching his hand as
      far up the piazza-post as he could, and swinging into a conversational
      posture,&mdash;&ldquo;d' you ever try whiskey&mdash;good odd Bourbon whiskey&mdash;with
      white-pine chips in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maynard looked up with interest, but, shaking her head, coughed for
      no.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should like to have you try that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it do?&rdquo; she gasped, when she could get her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's soothin' t' the cough, and it builds ye up, every ways. Why,
      my brother,&rdquo; continued the factotum, &ldquo;he died of consumption when I was a
      boy,&mdash;reg'lar old New England consumption. Don't hardly ever hear of
      it any more, round here. Well, I don't suppose there's been a case of
      reg'lar old New England consumption&mdash;well, not the old New England
      kind&mdash;since these woods growed up. He used to take whiskey with
      white-pine chips in it; and I can remember hearin 'em say that it done him
      more good than all the doctor's stuff. He'd been out to Demarary, and
      everywheres, and he come home in the last stages, and took up with this
      whiskey with whitepine chips in it. Well, it's just like this, I presume
      it's the balsam in the chips. It don't make any difference how you git the
      balsam into your system, so 's 't you git it there. I should like to have
      you try whiskey with white-pine chips in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked convincingly at Mrs. Maynard, who said she should like to try
      it. &ldquo;It's just bronchial with me, you know. But I should like to try it. I
      know it would be soothing; and I've always heard that whiskey was the very
      thing to build you up. But,&rdquo; she added, lapsing from this vision of
      recovery, &ldquo;I couldn't take it unless Grace said so. She'd be sure to find
      it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, look here,&rdquo; said Barlow. &ldquo;As far forth as that goes, you could keep
      the bottle in my room. Not but what I believe in going by your doctor's
      directions, it don't matter who your doctor is. I ain't sayin' nothin'
      against Miss Breen, you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maynard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never see much nicer ladies than her and her mother in the house. But
      you just tell her about the whiskey with the white-pine chips in it. Maybe
      she never heard of it. Well, she hain't had a great deal of experience
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maynard. &ldquo;And I think she'll be glad to hear of it. You
      may be sure I'll tell her, Mr. Barlow. Grace is everything for the
      balsamic properties of the air, down here. That's what she said; and as
      you say, it doesn't matter how you get the balsam into your system, so you
      get it there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the factotum, in a tone of misgiving, as if the repetition of
      the words presented the theory in a new light to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I think is, and what I'm always telling Grace,&rdquo; pursued Mrs.
      Maynard, in that confidential spirit in which she helplessly spoke of her
      friends by their first names to every one, &ldquo;that if I could once get my
      digestion all right, then the cough would stop of itself. The doctor said&mdash;Dr.
      Nixon, that is&mdash;that it was more than half the digestion any way. But
      just as soon as I eat anything&mdash;or if I over-eat a little&mdash;then
      that tickling in my throat begins, and then I commence coughing; and I'm
      back just where I was. It's the digestion. I oughtn't to have eaten that
      mince pie, yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Barlow. Then he said, in indirect defence of the kitchen,
      &ldquo;I think you had n't ought to be out in the night air,&mdash;well, not a
      great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't suppose it does do me much good,&rdquo; Mrs. Maynard said,
      turning her eyes seaward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barlow let his hand drop from the piazza post, and slouched in-doors; but
      he came out again as if pricked by conscience to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, you know, it did n't cure him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cure him?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Maynard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whiskey with the white-pine chips in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cure who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Oh, yes! But mine's only bronchial. I think it might do me good. I
      shall tell Grace about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barlow looked troubled, as if his success in the suggestion of this remedy
      were not finally a pleasure; but as Mrs. Maynard kept her eyes
      persistently turned from him, and was evidently tired, he had nothing for
      it but to go in-doors again. He met Grace, and made way for her on the
      threshold to pass out.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she joined Mrs. Maynard, &ldquo;Well, Grace,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;I do believe
      you are right. I have taken some more cold. But that shows that it does
      n't get worse of itself, and I think we ought to be encouraged by that.
      I'm going to be more careful of the night air after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think the night air was the worst thing about it, Louise,&rdquo; said
      Grace bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the damp from the sand? I put on my rubbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean the damp sand,&rdquo; said Grace, beginning to pull over some
      sewing which she had in her lap, and looking down at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maynard watched her a while in expectation that she would say more,
      but she did not speak. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;well!&rdquo; she was forced to continue
      herself, &ldquo;if you're going to go on with that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question is,&rdquo; said Grace, getting the thread she wanted, &ldquo;whether you
      are going on with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I can't see any possible harm in it,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Maynard. &ldquo;I
      suppose you don't exactly like my going with Mr. Libby, and I know that
      under some circumstances it would n't be quite the thing. But did n't I
      tell you last night how he lived with us in Europe? And when we were all
      coming over on the steamer together Mr. Libby and Mr. Maynard were
      together the whole time, smoking and telling stories. They were the
      greatest friends! Why, it isn't as if he was a stranger, or an enemy of
      Mr. Maynard's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace dropped her sewing into her lap. &ldquo;Really, Louise, you're
      incredible!&rdquo; She looked sternly at the invalid; but broke into a laugh, on
      which Mrs. Maynard waited with a puzzled face. As Grace said nothing more,
      she helplessly resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did n't expect to go down the cliff when he first called in the
      evening. But he said he would help me up again, and&mdash;he did, nicely.
      I was n't exhausted a bit; and how I took more cold I can't understand; I
      was wrapped up warmly. I think I took the cold when I was sitting there
      after our game of croquet, with my shawl off. Don't you think so?&rdquo; she
      wheedled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did nothing but talk about you, Grace,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maynard, with a sly
      look at the other. &ldquo;He's awfully afraid of you, and he kept asking about
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise,&rdquo; said the other, gravely ignoring these facts, &ldquo;I never undertook
      the care of you socially, and I object very much to lecturing you. You are
      nearly as old as I am, and you have had a great deal more experience of
      life than I have.&rdquo; Mrs. Maynard sighed deeply in assent. &ldquo;But it does n't
      seem to have taught you that if you will provoke people to talk of you,
      you must expect criticism. One after another you've told nearly every
      woman in the house your affairs, and they have all sympathized with you
      and pitied you. I shall have to be plain, and tell you that I can't have
      them sneering and laughing at any one who is my guest. I can't let you
      defy public opinion here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Grace,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maynard, buoyed above offence at her friend's
      words by her consciousness of the point she was about to make, &ldquo;you defy
      public opinion yourself a good deal more than I do, every minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? How do I defy it?&rdquo; demanded Grace indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By being a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace opened her lips to speak, but she was not a ready person, and she
      felt the thrust. Before she could say anything Mrs. Maynard went on:
      &ldquo;There isn't one of them that does n't think you're much more scandalous
      than if you were the greatest flirt alive. But, I don't mind them, and why
      should you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The serious girl whom she addressed was in that helpless subjection to the
      truth in which so many New England women pass their lives. She could not
      deny the truth which lurked in the exaggeration of these words, and it
      unnerved her, as the fact that she was doing what the vast majority of
      women considered unwomanly always unnerved her when she suffered herself
      to think of it. &ldquo;You are right, Louise,&rdquo; she said meekly and sadly. &ldquo;They
      think as well of you as they do of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's just what I said!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maynard, glad of her successful
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      But however disabled, her friend resumed: &ldquo;The only safe way for you is to
      take the ground that so long as you wear your husband's name you must
      honor it, no matter how cruel and indifferent to you he has been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Maynard ruefully, &ldquo;of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that you must n't even have the appearance of liking admiration,
      or what you call attentions. It's wicked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; murmured the culprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been brought up to have such different ideas of divorce from
      what I have,&rdquo; continued Grace, &ldquo;that I don't feel as if I had any right to
      advise you about what you are to do after you gain your suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not want to get married again for one while; I know that much,&rdquo;
       Mrs. Maynard interpolated self-righteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But till you do gain it, you ought not to regard it as emancipating you
      in the slightest degree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; came in sad assent from the victim of the law's delays.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I want you to promise me that you won't go walking with Mr. Libby any
      more; and that you won't even see him alone, after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, but Grace!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maynard, as much in amazement as in
      annoyance. &ldquo;You don't seem to understand! Have n't I told you he was a
      friend of the family? He's quite as much Mr. Maynard's friend as he is
      mine. I'm sure,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;if I asked Mr. Libby, I should never think of
      getting divorced. He's all for George; and it's as much as I can do to put
      up with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter. That does n't alter the appearance to people here. I don't
      wish you to go with him alone any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Grace, I won't,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maynard earnestly. &ldquo;I won't, indeed. And
      that makes me think: he wanted you to go along this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go along? Wanted me&mdash;What are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I suppose that's his boat, out there, now.&rdquo; Mrs. Maynard pointed to
      a little craft just coming to anchor inside the reef. &ldquo;He said he wanted
      me to take a sail with him, this morning; and he said he would come up and
      ask you, too. I do hope you'll go, Grace. It's just as calm; and he always
      has a man with him to help sail the boat, so there is n't the least
      danger.&rdquo; Grace looked at her in silent sorrow, and Mrs. Maynard went on
      with sympathetic seriousness: &ldquo;Oh! there's one thing I want to ask you
      about, Grace: I don't like to have any concealments from you.&rdquo; Grace did
      not speak, but she permitted Mrs. Maynard to proceed: &ldquo;Barlow recommended
      it, and he's lived here a great while. His brother took it, and he had the
      regular old New England consumption. I thought I shouldn't like to try it
      without your knowing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try it? What are you talking about, Louise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, whiskey with white-pine chips in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace rose, and moved towards the door, with the things dropping from her
      lap. One of these was a spool, that rolled down the steps and out upon the
      sandy road. She turned to pursue it, and recovered it at the cost of
      dropping her scissors and thimble out of opposite sides of her skirt,
      which she had gathered up apronwise to hold her work. When she rose from
      the complicated difficulty, in which Mrs. Maynard had amiably lent her
      aid, she confronted Mr. Libby, who was coming towards them from the cliff.
      She gave him a stiff nod, and attempted to move away; but in turning round
      and about she had spun herself into the folds of a stout linen thread
      escaping from its spool. These gyves not only bound her skirts but
      involved her feet in an extraordinary mesh, which tightened at the first
      step and brought her to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maynard began to laugh and cough, as Mr. Libby came to her friend's
      help. He got the spool in his hand, and walked around her in the endeavor
      to free her; but in vain. She extended him the scissors with the stern
      passivity of a fate. &ldquo;Cut it,&rdquo; she commanded, and Mr. Libby knelt before
      her and obeyed. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she said, taking back the scissors; and now she
      sat down again, and began deliberately to put up her work in her
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'll go out and get my things. I won't be gone half a minute, Mr.
      Libby,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maynard, with her first breath, as she vanished indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Libby leaned against the post lately occupied by the factotum in his
      talk with Mrs. Maynard, and looked down at Grace as she bent over her
      work. If he wished to speak to her, and was wavering as to the appropriate
      style of address for a handsome girl, who was at once a young lady and a
      physician, she spared him the agony of a decision by looking up at him
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;that you feel like a sail, this morning? Did Mrs.
      Maynard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to excuse myself,&rdquo; answered Grace, with a conscience against
      saying she was sorry. &ldquo;I am a very bad sailor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so am I, for that matter,&rdquo; said Mr. Libby. &ldquo;But it's smooth as a
      pond, to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace made no direct response, and he grew visibly uncomfortable under the
      cold abstraction of the gaze with which she seemed to look through him.
      &ldquo;Mrs. Maynard tells me you came over with her from Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; cried the young man, the light of pleasant recollection kindling
      in his gay eyes. &ldquo;We had a good time. Maynard was along: he's a first-rate
      fellow. I wish he were here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;I wish so, too.&rdquo; She did not know what to make of this
      frankness of the young man's, and she did not know whether to consider him
      very depraved or very innocent. In her question she continued to stare at
      him, without being aware of the embarrassment to which she was putting
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard of Mrs. Maynard's being here, and I thought I should find him,
      too. I came over yesterday to get him to go into the woods with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace decided that this was mere effrontery. &ldquo;It is a pity that he is not
      here,&rdquo; she said; and though it ought to have been possible for her to go
      on and rebuke the young fellow for bestowing upon Mrs. Maynard the
      comradeship intended for her husband, it was not so. She could only look
      severely at him, and trust that he might conceive the intention which she
      could not express. She rebelled against the convention and against her own
      weakness, which would not let her boldly interfere in what she believed a
      wrong; she had defied society, in the mass, but here, with this man, whom
      as an atom of the mass she would have despised, she was powerless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever seen him?&rdquo; Libby asked, perhaps clinging to Maynard because
      he was a topic of conversation in default of which there might be nothing
      to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 's funny. He's got lots of that Western humor, and he tells a story
      better than any man I ever saw. There was one story of his&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no sense of humor,&rdquo; interrupted Grace impatiently. &ldquo;Mr. Libby,&rdquo;
       she broke out, &ldquo;I 'm sorry that you've asked Mrs. Maynard to take a sail
      with you. The sea air&rdquo;&mdash;she reddened with the shame of not being able
      to proceed without this wretched subterfuge&mdash;&ldquo;won't do her any good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;you must n't let her go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't choose to forbid her,&rdquo; Grace began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;I'll be back in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, and ran to the edge of the cliff, over which he vanished, and
      he did not reappear till Mrs. Maynard had rejoined Grace on the piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you won't mind its being a little rough, Mrs. Maynard,&rdquo; he said,
      breathing quickly. &ldquo;Adams thinks we're going to have it pretty fresh
      before we get back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I don't want to go, then!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maynard, in petulant
      disappointment, letting her wraps fall upon a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Libby looked at Grace, who haughtily rejected a part in the
      conspiracy. &ldquo;I wish you to go, Louise,&rdquo; she declared indignantly. &ldquo;I will
      take the risk of all the harm that comes to you from the bad weather.&rdquo; She
      picked up the shawls, and handed them to Mr. Libby, on whom her eyes
      blazed their contempt and wonder. It cost a great deal of persuasion and
      insistence now to make Mrs. Maynard go, and he left all this to Grace, not
      uttering a word till he gave Mrs. Maynard his hand to help her down the
      steps. Then he said, &ldquo;Well, I wonder what Miss Breen does want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'm sure I don't know,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;At first she did n't want me to
      go, this morning, and now she makes me. I do hope it is n't going to be a
      storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it is. A little fresh, perhaps. I thought you might be
      seasick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you remember? I'm never seasick! That's one of the worst signs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could be thoroughly seasick once, it would be the best thing I could
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she capricious?&rdquo; asked Mr. Libby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maynard, releasing her hand half-way down the steps,
      in order to enjoy her astonishment without limitation of any sort. &ldquo;Grace
      capricious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Libby, &ldquo;that's what I thought. Better take my hand again,&rdquo;
       and he secured that of Mrs. Maynard, who continued her descent. &ldquo;I suppose
      I don't understand her exactly. Perhaps she did n't like my not calling
      her Doctor. I did n't call her anything. I suppose she thought I was
      dodging it. I was. I should have had to call her Miss Breen, if I called
      her anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wouldn't have cared. She is n't a doctor for the name of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you think it's a pity?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her being a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell her you say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don't. But don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I would n't want to be one,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mayward candidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's all right, if she does it from a sense of duty, as you
      say,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, she's all right. And she's just as much of a girl as anybody;
      though she don't know it,&rdquo; Mrs. Maynard added astutely. &ldquo;Why would n't she
      come with us? Were you afraid to ask her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said she was n't a good sailor. Perhaps she thought we were too
      young. She must be older than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you, too!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maynard, with good-natured derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't look old,&rdquo; returned Mr. Libby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's twenty-eight. How old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised the census-taker not to tell till his report came out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the color of her hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better look out, Mr. Libby!&rdquo; said Mrs. Maynard, putting her foot
      on the ground at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked across the beach to where his dory lay, and Grace saw him
      pulling out to the sail boat before she went in from the piazza. Then she
      went to her mother's room. The elderly lady was keeping indoors, upon a
      theory that the dew was on, and that it was not wholesome to go out till
      it was off. She asked, according to her habit when she met her daughter
      alone, &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Maynard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you always ask that, mother?&rdquo; retorted Grace, with her growing
      irritation in regard to her patient intensified by the recent interview.
      &ldquo;I can't be with her the whole time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you could,&rdquo; said Mrs. Breen, with noncommittal suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace could not keep herself from demanding, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; as her mother
      expected, though she knew why too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she wouldn't be in mischief then,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Breen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's in mischief now!&rdquo; cried the girl vehemently; &ldquo;and it's my fault! I
      did it. I sent her off to sail with that ridiculous Mr. Libby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Breen, in her turn, with unbroken tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am a fool, and I couldn't help him lie out of his engagement
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n't he want to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Yes. They both wanted me to go with them. Simpletons! And
      while she had gone up-stairs for her wraps I managed to make him
      understand that I did n't wish her to go, either; and he ran down to his
      boat, and came back with a story about its going to be rough, and looked
      at me perfectly delighted, as if I should be pleased. Of course, then, I
      made him take her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is n't it going to be rough?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, mother, the sea's like glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Breen turned the subject. &ldquo;You would have done better, Grace, to
      begin as you had planned. Your going to Fall River, and beginning practice
      there among those factory children, was the only thing that I ever
      entirely liked in your taking up medicine. There was sense in that. You
      had studied specially for it. You could have done good there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; sighed the girl, &ldquo;I know. But what was I to do, when she came
      to us, sick and poor? I couldn't turn my back on her, especially after
      always befriending her, as I used to, at school, and getting her to depend
      on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how you ever liked her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Breen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did like her. I pitied her. I always thought her a poor, flimsy
      little thing. But that ought n't to make any difference, if she was in
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen conceded, and in compensation Grace admitted something
      more on her side: &ldquo;She's worse than she used to be,&mdash;sillier. I don't
      suppose she has a wrong thought; but she's as light as foam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is n't the wicked people who, do the harm,&rdquo; said Mrs. Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure that this air would be everything for her; and so it would,
      with any ordinary case. But a child would take better care of itself. I
      have to watch her every minute, like a child; and I never know what she
      will do next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it's a burden,&rdquo; said Mrs. Breen, with a sympathy which she had not
      expressed before. &ldquo;And you're a good girl, Grace,&rdquo; she added in very
      unwonted recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grateful tears stole into the daughter's eyes, but she kept a firm
      face, even after they began to follow one another down her cheeks. &ldquo;And if
      Louise had n't come, you know, mother, that I was anxious to have some
      older person with me when I went to Fall River. I was glad to have this
      respite; it gives me a chance to think. I felt a little timid about
      beginning alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man would n't,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I am not a man. I have accepted that; with all the rest. I don't
      rebel against being a woman. If I had been a man, I should n't have
      studied medicine. You know that. I wished to be a physician because I was
      a woman, and because&mdash;because&mdash;I had failed where&mdash;other
      women's hopes are.&rdquo; She said it out firmly, and her mother softened to her
      in proportion to the girl's own strength. &ldquo;I might have been just a nurse.
      You know I should have been willing to be that, but I thought I could be
      something more. But it's no use talking.&rdquo; She added, after an interval, in
      which her mother rocked to and fro with a gentle motion that searched the
      joints of her chair, and brought out its most plaintive squeak in pathetic
      iteration, and watched Grace, as she sat looking seaward through the open
      window, &ldquo;I think it's rather hard, mother, that you should be always
      talking as if I wished to take my calling mannishly. All that I intend is
      not to take it womanishly; but as for not being a woman about it, or about
      anything, that's simply impossible. A woman is reminded of her
      insufficiency to herself every hour of the day. And it's always a man that
      comes to her help. I dropped some things out of my lap down there, and by
      the time I had gathered them up I was wound round and round with linen
      thread so that I could n't move a step, and Mr. Libby cut me loose. I
      could have done it myself, but it seemed right and natural that he should
      do it. I dare say he plumed himself upon his service to me,&mdash;that
      would be natural, too. I have things enough to keep me meek, mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not look round at Mrs. Breen, who said, &ldquo;I think you are morbid
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And I have the satisfaction of knowing that whatever people think of
      Louise's giddiness, I'm, a great deal more scandalous to them than she is
      simply because I wish to do some good in the world, in a way that women
      have n't done it, usually.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are morbid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Talk about men being obstacles! It's other women! There isn't a
      woman in the house that would n't sooner trust herself in the hands of the
      stupidest boy that got his diploma with me than she would in mine. Louise
      knows it, and she feels that she has a claim upon me in being my patient.
      And I 've no influence with her about her conduct because she understands
      perfectly well that they all consider me much worse. She prides herself on
      doing me justice. She patronizes me. She tells me that I'm just as nice
      as, if I hadn't 'been through all that.'&rdquo; Grace rose, and a laugh, which
      was half a sob, broke from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Breen could not feel the humor of the predicament. &ldquo;She puts you in a
      false position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go and see where that poor little wretch of a child is,&rdquo; said
      Grace, going out of the room. She returned in an hour, and asked her
      mother for the arnica. &ldquo;Bella has had a bump,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, have you been all this time looking for her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I couldn't find her, and I've been reading. Barlow has just brought
      her in. HE could find her. She fell out of a tree, and she's frightfully
      bruised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was making search on a closet shelf as she talked. When she reappeared
      with the bottle in her hand, her mother asked, &ldquo;Is n't it very hot and
      close?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should certainly think they would perish,&rdquo; said Mrs. Breen, hazarding
      the pronoun, with a woman's confidence that her interlocutor would apply
      it correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Grace had seen Bella properly bathed and brown-papered, and in the
      way to forgetfulness of her wounds in sleep, she came down to the piazza,
      and stood looking out to sea. The ladies appeared one by one over the edge
      of the cliff, and came up, languidly stringing their shawls after them, or
      clasping their novels to their bosoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't a breath down there,&rdquo; they said, one after another. The last
      one added, &ldquo;Barlow says it's the hottest day he's ever seen here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a minute Barlow himself appeared at the head of the steps with the
      ladies' remaining wraps, and confirmed their report in person. &ldquo;I tell
      you,&rdquo; he said, wiping his forehead, &ldquo;it's a ripper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be an awful day in town,&rdquo; said one of the ladies, fanning herself
      with a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that to-day's Advertiser, Mrs. Alger?&rdquo; asked another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no! yesterday's. We sha'n't have today's till this afternoon.
      It shows what a new arrival you are, Mrs. Scott&mdash;your asking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. But it's such a comfort being where you can see the
      Advertiser the same morning. I always look at the Weather Report the first
      thing. I like to know what the weather is going to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't at Jocelyn's. You can only know what it's been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Barlow interposed, jealous for Jocelyn's, &ldquo;you can most al'ays
      tell by the look o' things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said one of the ladies; &ldquo;but I'd rather trust the Weather Report.
      It's wonderful how it comes true. I don't think there 's anything that you
      miss more in Europe than our American Weather Report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure you miss the oysters,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the first admitted, &ldquo;you do miss the oysters. It was the last of
      the R months when we landed in New York; and do you know what we did the
      first thing&mdash;? We drove to Fulton Market, and had one of those Fulton
      Market broils! My husband said we should have had it if it had been July.
      He used to dream of the American oysters when we were in Europe. Gentlemen
      are so fond of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barlow, from scanning the heavens, turned round and faced the company,
      which had drooped in several attitudes of exhaustion on the benching of
      the piazza. &ldquo;Well, I can most al'ays tell about Jocelyn's as good as the
      Weather Report. I told Mrs. Maynard here this mornin' that the fog was
      goin' to burn off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burn off?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Alger. &ldquo;I should think it had!&rdquo; The other ladies
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you'll see,&rdquo; added Barlow, &ldquo;that the wind 'll change at noon, and
      we'll have it cooler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's as hot on the water as it is here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Scott, &ldquo;I should
      think those people would get a sunstroke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so should I, Mrs. Scott,&rdquo; cordially exclaimed a little fat lady, as
      if here at last were an opinion in which all might rejoice to sympathize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's never so hot on the water, Mrs. Merritt,&rdquo; said Mrs. Alger, with the
      instructiveness of an old habitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not at Jocelyn's,&rdquo; suggested Barlow. Mrs. Alger stopped fanning
      herself with her newspaper, and looked at him. Upon her motion, the other
      ladies looked at Barlow. Doubtless he felt that his social acceptability
      had ceased with his immediate usefulness. But he appeared resolved to
      carry it off easily. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose I must go and pick my
      peas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one said anything to this. When the factotum had disappeared round the
      corner of the house, Mrs. Alger turned her head' aside, and glanced
      downward with an air of fatigue. In this manner Barlow was dismissed from
      the ladies' minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume,&rdquo; said young Mrs. Scott, with a deferential glance at Grace,
      &ldquo;that the sun is good for a person with lung-difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace silently refused to consider herself appealed to, and Mrs. Merritt
      said, &ldquo;Better than the moon, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the others tittered, but Grace looked up at Mrs. Merritt and said,
      &ldquo;I don't think Mrs. Maynard's case is so bad that she need be afraid of
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad to hear it!&rdquo; replied the other. She looked round, but
      was unable to form a party. By twos or threes they might have liked to
      take Mrs. Maynard to pieces; but no one cares to make unkind remarks
      before a whole company of people. Some of the ladies even began to say
      pleasant things about Mr. Libby, as if he were Grace's friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always like to see these fair men when they get tanned,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Alger. &ldquo;Their blue eyes look so very blue. And the backs of their necks&mdash;just
      like my boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you admire such a VERY fighting-clip as Mr. Libby has on?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      Scott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be nice for summer,&rdquo; returned the elder lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it certainly must,&rdquo; admitted the younger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;I wish I could go in the fighting-clip. One does
      n't know what to do with one's hair at the sea-side; it's always in the
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hair would be a public loss, Mrs. Frost,&rdquo; said Mrs. Alger. The
      others looked at her hair, as if they had seen it now for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't think so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost, in a sort of flattered coo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't have it cut off!&rdquo; pleaded a young girl, coming up and taking
      the beautiful mane, hanging loose after the bath, into her hand. Mrs.
      Frost put her arm round the girl's waist, and pulled her down against her
      shoulder. Upon reflection she also kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through a superstition, handed down from mother to daughter, that it is
      uncivil and even unkind not to keep saying something, they went on talking
      vapidities, where the same number of men, equally vacuous, would have
      remained silent; and some of them complained that the nervous strain of
      conversation took away all the good their bath had done them. Miss
      Gleason, who did not bathe, was also not a talker. She kept a bright-eyed
      reticence, but was apt to break out in rather enigmatical flashes, which
      resolved the matter in hand into an abstraction, and left the others with
      the feeling that she was a person of advanced ideas, but that, while
      rejecting historical Christianity, she believed in a God of Love. This
      Deity was said, upon closer analysis, to have proved to be a God of
      Sentiment, and Miss Gleason was herself a hero-worshiper, or, more
      strictly speaking, a heroine-worshiper. At present Dr. Breen was her cult,
      and she was apt to lie in wait for her idol, to beam upon it with her
      suggestive eyes, and evidently to expect it to say or do something
      remarkable, but not to suffer anything like disillusion or disappointment
      in any event. She would sometimes offer it suddenly a muddled depth of
      sympathy in such phrases as, &ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I don't see how you keep-up?&rdquo;
       and darkly insinuate that she appreciated all that Grace was doing. She
      seemed to rejoice in keeping herself at a respectful distance, to which
      she breathlessly retired, as she did now, after waylaying her at the top
      of the stairs, and confidentially darting at her the words, &ldquo;I'm so glad
      you don't like scandal!&rdquo;

      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After dinner the ladies tried to get a nap, but such of them as
      re-appeared on the piazza later agreed that it was perfectly useless. They
      tested every corner for a breeze, but the wind had fallen dead, and the
      vast sweep of sea seemed to smoulder under the sun. &ldquo;This is what Mr.
      Barlow calls having it cooler,&rdquo; said Mrs. Alger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some clouds that look like thunderheads in the west,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Frost, returning from an excursion to the part of the piazza commanding
      that quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it won't rain to-day,&rdquo; Mrs. Alger decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought there was always a breeze at Jocelyn's,&rdquo; Mrs. Scott observed,
      in the critical spirit of a recent arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There always is,&rdquo; the other explained, &ldquo;except the first week you're
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little breath, scarcely more than a sentiment of breeze, made itself
      felt. &ldquo;I do believe the wind has changed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost. &ldquo;It's east.&rdquo;
       The others owned one by one that it was so, and she enjoyed the merit of a
      discoverer; but her discovery was rapidly superseded. The clouds mounted
      in the west, and there came a time when the ladies disputed whether they
      had heard thunder or not: a faction contended for the bowling alley, and
      another faction held for a wagon passing over the bridge just before you
      reached Jocelyn's. But those who were faithful to the theory of thunder
      carried the day by a sudden crash that broke over the forest, and, dying
      slowly away among the low hills, left them deeply silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one,&rdquo; said Mrs. Alger, &ldquo;ought to go for those children.&rdquo; On this it
      appeared that there were two minds as to where the children were,&mdash;whether
      on the beach or in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was n't that thunder, Grace?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Breen, with the accent by which
      she implicated her daughter in whatever happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Grace, from where she sat at her window, looking seaward, and
      waiting tremulously for her mother's next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Maynard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is n't back, yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Breen, &ldquo;he really did expect rough weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must,&rdquo; returned Grace, in a guilty whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a pity,&rdquo; remarked her mother, &ldquo;that you made them go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She rose, and, stretching herself far out of the window, searched
      the inexorable expanse of sea. It had already darkened at the verge, and
      the sails of some fishing-craft flecked a livid wall with their white, but
      there was no small boat in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anything happened to them,&rdquo; her mother continued, &ldquo;I should feel
      terribly for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should feel terribly for myself,&rdquo; Grace responded, with her eyes still
      seaward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you think they went?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't ask,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I wouldn't,&rdquo; she added, in devotion to
      the whole truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is all of the same piece,&rdquo; said Mrs. Breen. Grace did not ask
      what the piece was. She remained staring at the dark wall across the sea,
      and spiritually confronting her own responsibility, no atom of which she
      rejected. She held herself in every way responsible,&mdash;for doubting
      that poor young fellow's word, and then for forcing that reluctant
      creature to go with him, and forbidding by her fierce insistence any
      attempt of his at explanation; she condemned herself to perpetual remorse
      with even greater zeal than her mother would have sentenced her, and she
      would not permit herself any respite when a little sail, which she knew
      for theirs, blew round the point. It seemed to fly along just on the
      hither side of that mural darkness, skilfully tacking to reach the end of
      the-reef before the wall pushed it on the rocks. Suddenly, the long low
      stretch of the reef broke into white foam, and then passed from sight
      under the black wall, against which the little sail still flickered. The
      girl fetched a long, silent breath. They were inside the reef, in
      comparatively smooth water, and to her ignorance they were safe. But the
      rain would be coming in another moment, and Mrs. Maynard would be
      drenched; and Grace would be to blame for her death. She ran to the
      closet, and pulled down her mother's India-rubber cloak and her own, and
      fled out-of-doors, to be ready on the beach with the wrap, against their
      landing. She met the other ladies on the stairs and in the hall, and they
      clamored at her; but she glided through them like something in a dream,
      and then she heard a shouting in her ear, and felt herself caught and held
      up against the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where in land be you goin', Miss Breen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barlow, in a long, yellow oil-skin coat and sou'wester hat, kept pushing
      her forward to the edge of the cliff, as he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going down to meet them!&rdquo; she screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope you WILL meet 'em. But I guess you better go back to the
      house. Hey? WUNT? Well; come along, then, if they ain't past doctorin' by
      the time they git ashore! Pretty well wrapped up, any way!&rdquo; he roared; and
      she perceived that she had put on her waterproof and drawn the hood over
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those steps to the beach had made her giddy when she descended with
      leisure for such dismay; but now, with the tempest flattening her against
      the stair-case, and her gossamer clutching and clinging to every surface,
      and again twisting itself about her limbs, she clambered down as swiftly
      and recklessly as Barlow himself, and followed over the beach beside the
      men who were pulling a boat down the sand at a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me get in!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;I wish to go with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take hold of the girl, Barlow!&rdquo; shouted one of the men. &ldquo;She's crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tumbled himself with four others into the boat, and they all struck out
      together through the froth and swirl of the waves. She tried to free
      herself from Barlow, so as to fling the waterproof into the boat. &ldquo;Take
      this, then. She'll be soaked through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barlow broke into a grim laugh. &ldquo;She won't need it, except for a
      windin'-sheet!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Don't you see the boat's drivin' right on t'
      the sand? She'll be kindlin' wood in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they're inside the reef! They can come to anchor!&rdquo; she shrieked in
      reply. He answered her with a despairing grin and a shake of the head.
      &ldquo;They can't. What has your boat gone out for, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To pick 'em up out the sea. But they'll never git 'em alive. Look how she
      slaps her boom int' the water! Well! He DOES know how to handle a boat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Libby at the helm, as she could dimly see, but what it was in his
      management that moved Barlow's praise she could not divine. The boat
      seemed to be aimed for the shore, and to be rushing, head on, upon the
      beach; her broad sail was blown straight out over her bow, and flapped
      there like a banner, while the heavy boom hammered the water as she rose
      and fell. A jagged line of red seamed the breast of the dark wall behind;
      a rending crash came, and as if fired upon, the boat flung up her sail, as
      a wild fowl flings up its wing when shot, and lay tossing keel up, on the
      top of the waves. It all looked scarcely a stone's cast away, though it
      was vastly farther. A figure was seen to drag itself up out of the sea,
      and fall over into the boat, hovering and pitching in the surrounding
      welter, and struggling to get at two other figures clinging to the wreck.
      Suddenly the men in the boat pulled away, and Grace uttered a cry of
      despair and reproach: &ldquo;Why, they're leaving it, they're leaving it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't expect 'em to tow the wreck ashore in this weather, do ye?&rdquo; shouted
      Barlow. &ldquo;They've got the folks all safe enough. I tell ye I see 'em!&rdquo; he
      cried, at a wild look of doubt in her eyes. &ldquo;Run to the house, there, and
      get everything in apple-pie order. There's goin' to be a chance for some
      of your doctor'n' now, if ye know how to fetch folks to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the little house on the beach, which the children were always
      prying and peering into, trying the lock, and wondering what the boat was
      like, which Grace had seen launched. Now the door yielded to her, and
      within she found a fire kindled in the stove, blankets laid in order, and
      flasks of brandy in readiness in the cupboard. She put the blankets to
      heat for instant use, and prepared for the work of resuscitation. When she
      could turn from them to the door, she met there a procession that
      approached with difficulty, heads down and hustled by the furious blast
      through which the rain now hissed and shot. Barlow and one of the boat's
      crew were carrying Mrs. Maynard, and bringing up the rear of the huddling
      oil-skins and sou'westers came Libby, soaked, and dripping as he walked.
      His eyes and Grace's encountered with a mutual avoidance; but whatever was
      their sense of blame, their victim had no reproaches to make herself. She
      was not in need of restoration. She was perfectly alive, and apparently
      stimulated by her escape from deadly peril to a vivid conception of the
      wrong that had been done her. If the adventure had passed off
      prosperously, she was the sort of woman to have owned to her friend that
      she ought not to have thought of going. But the event had obliterated
      these scruples, and she realized herself as a hapless creature who had
      been thrust on to dangers from which she would have shrunk. &ldquo;Well, Grace!&rdquo;
       she began, with a voice and look before which the other quailed, &ldquo;I hope
      you are satisfied! All the time I was clinging to that wretched boat. I
      was wondering how you would feel. Yes, my last thoughts were of you. I
      pitied you. I did n't see how you could ever have peace again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Mrs. Maynard!&rdquo; cried Libby. &ldquo;There's no, time for that, now.
      What had best be done, Miss Green? Had n't she better be got up to the
      house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by all means,&rdquo; answered Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might as well let me die here,&rdquo; Mrs. Maynard protested, as Grace
      wrapped the blankets round her dripping dress. &ldquo;I 'm as wet as I can be,
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Libby began to laugh at these inconsequences, to which he was probably
      well used. &ldquo;You would n't have time to die here. And we want to give this
      hydropathic treatment a fair trial. You've tried the douche, and now
      you're to have the pack.&rdquo; He summoned two of the boatmen, who had been
      considerately dripping outside, in order to leave the interior to the
      shipwrecked company, and they lifted Mrs. Maynard, finally wrapped in,
      Grace's India-rubber cloak, and looking like some sort of strange, huge
      chrysalis, and carried her out into the storm and up the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace followed last with Mr. Libby, very heavyhearted and reckless. She
      had not only that sore self-accusal; but the degradation of the affair,
      its grotesqueness, its spiritual squalor, its utter gracelessness, its
      entire want of dignity, were bitter as death in her proud soul. It was not
      in this shameful guise that she had foreseen the good she was to do. And
      it had all come through her own wilfulness and self-righteousness. The
      tears could mix unseen with the rain that drenched her face, but they
      blinded her, and half-way up the steps she stumbled on her skirt, and
      would have fallen, if the young man had not caught her. After that, from
      time to time he put his arm about her, and stayed her against the gusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they reached the top he said, &ldquo;Miss Breen, I'm awfully sorry for
      all this. Mrs. Maynard will be ashamed of what she said. Confound it! If
      Maynard were only here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should she be ashamed?&rdquo; demanded Grace. &ldquo;If she had been drowned, I
      should have murdered her, and I'm responsible if anything happens to her,&mdash;I
      am to blame.&rdquo; She escaped from him, and ran into the house. He slunk round
      the piazza to the kitchen door, under the eyes of the ladies watching at
      the parlor windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder he let the others carry her up,&rdquo; said Miss Gleason. &ldquo;Of course,
      he will marry her now,&mdash;when she gets her divorce.&rdquo; She spoke of Mrs.
      Maynard, whom her universal toleration not only included in the mercy
      which the opinions of the other ladies denied her, but round whom her
      romance cast a halo of pretty possibilities as innocently sentimental as
      the hopes of a young girl.

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Grace was sitting beside her patient, with whom she had
      spent the night. It was possibly Mrs. Maynard's spiritual toughness which
      availed her, for she did not seem much the worse for her adventure: she
      had a little fever, and she was slightly hoarser; but she had died none of
      the deaths that she projected during the watches of the night, and for
      which she had chastened the spirit of her physician by the repeated
      assurance that she forgave her everything, and George Maynard everything,
      and hoped that they would be good to her poor little Bella. She had the
      child brought from its crib to her own bed, and moaned over it; but with
      the return of day and the duties of life she appeared to feel that she had
      carried her forgiveness far enough, and was again remembering her injuries
      against Grace, as she lay in her morning gown on the lounge which had been
      brought in for her from the parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Grace, I shall always say if I had died and I may die yet&mdash;that
      I did not wish to go out with Mr. Libby, and that I went purely to please
      you. You forced me to go. I can't understand why you did it; for I don't
      suppose you wanted to kill us, whatever you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace could not lift her head. She bowed it over the little girl whom she
      had on her knee, and who was playing with the pin at her throat, in
      apparent unconsciousness of all that was said. But she had really followed
      it, with glimpses of intelligence, as children do, and now at this
      negative accusal she lifted her hand, and suddenly struck Grace a stinging
      blow on the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maynard sprang from her lounge. &ldquo;Why, Bella! you worthless little
      wretch!&rdquo; She caught her from Grace's knee, and shook her violently. Then,
      casting the culprit from her at random, she flung herself down again in a
      fit of coughing, while the child fled to Grace for consolation, and,
      wildly sobbing, buried her face in the lap of her injured friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what I shall do about that child!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maynard. &ldquo;She
      has George Maynard's temper right over again. I feel dreadfully, Grace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind it,&rdquo; said Grace, fondling the child, and half addressing
      it. &ldquo;I suppose Bella thought I had been unkind to her mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just it!&rdquo; exclaimed Louise. &ldquo;When you've been kindness itself!
      Don't I owe everything to you? I should n't be alive at this moment if it
      were not for your treatment. Oh, Grace!&rdquo; She began to cough again; the
      paroxysm increased in vehemence. She caught her handkerchief from her
      lips; it was spotted with blood. She sprang to her feet, and regarded it
      with impersonal sternness. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am sick, and I want a
      doctor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A doctor,&rdquo; Grace meekly echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I can't be trifled with any longer. I want a man doctor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace had looked at the handkerchief. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, with
      coldness. &ldquo;I shall not stand in your way of calling another physician. But
      if it will console you, I can tell you that the blood on your handkerchief
      means nothing worth speaking of. Whom shall I send for?&rdquo; she asked,
      turning to go out of the roam. &ldquo;I wish to be your friend still, and I will
      do anything I can to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Grace Breen! Is that the way you talk to me?&rdquo; whimpered Mrs. Maynard.
      &ldquo;You know that I don't mean to give you up. I'm not a stone; I have some
      feeling. I did n't intend to dismiss you, but I thought perhaps you would
      like to have a consultation about it. I should think it was time to have a
      consultation, should n't you? Of course, I'm not alarmed, but I know it's
      getting serious, and I'm afraid that your medicine is n't active enough.
      That's it; it's perfectly good medicine, but it is n't active. They've all
      been saying that I ought to have something active. Why not try the whiskey
      with the white-pine chips in it? I'm sure it's indicated.&rdquo; In her long
      course of medication she had picked up certain professional phrases, which
      she used with amusing seriousness. &ldquo;It would be active, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace did not reply. As she stood smoothing the head of the little girl,
      who had followed her to the door, and now leaned against her, hiding her
      tearful face in Grace's dress, she said, &ldquo;I don't know of any homoeopathic
      physician in this neighborhood. I don't believe there's one nearer than
      Boston, and I should make myself ridiculous in calling one so far for a
      consultation. But I'm quite willing you should call one, and I will send
      for you at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wouldn't you consult with him, after he came?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. It would be absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't like to have a doctor come all the way from Boston,&rdquo; mused
      Mrs. Maynard, sinking on the lounge again. &ldquo;There must be a doctor in the
      neighborhood. It can't be so healthy as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's an allopathic physician at Corbitant,&rdquo; said Grace passively. &ldquo;A
      very good one, I believe,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, then!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maynard, with immense relief. &ldquo;Consult with
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've told you, Louise, that I would not consult with anybody. And I
      certainly wouldn't consult with a physician whose ideas and principles I
      knew nothing about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why but, Grace,&rdquo; Mrs. Maynard expostulated. &ldquo;Is n't that rather
      prejudiced?&rdquo; She began to take an impartial interest in Grace's position,
      and fell into an argumentative tone. &ldquo;If two heads are better than one,&mdash;and
      everybody says they are,&mdash;I don't see how you can consistently refuse
      to talk with another physician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't explain to you, Louise,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;But you can call Dr.
      Mulbridge, if you wish. That will be the right way for you to do, if you
      have lost confidence in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have n't lost confidence in you, Grace. I don't see how you can talk
      so. You can give me bread pills, if you like, or air pills, and I will
      take them gladly. I believe in you perfectly. But I do think that in a
      matter of this kind, where my health, and perhaps my life, is concerned, I
      ought to have a little say. I don't ask you to give up your principles,
      and I don't dream of giving you up, and yet you won't just to please me!&mdash;exchange
      a few words with another doctor about my case, merely because he's
      allopathic. I should call it bigotry, and I don't see how you can call it
      anything else.&rdquo; There was a sound of voices at the door outside, and she
      called cheerily, &ldquo;Come in, Mr. Libby,&mdash;come in! There's nobody but
      Grace here,&rdquo; she added, as the young man tentatively opened the door, and
      looked in. He wore an evening dress, even to the white cravat, and he
      carried in his hand a crush hat: there was something anomalous in his
      appearance, beyond the phenomenal character of his costume, and he blushed
      consciously as he bowed to Grace, and then at her motion shook hands with
      her. Mrs. Maynard did not give herself the fatigue of rising; she
      stretched her hand to him from the lounge, and he took it without the joy
      which he had shown when Grace made him the same advance. &ldquo;How very swell
      you look. Going to an evening party this morning?&rdquo; she cried; and after
      she had given him a second glance of greater intensity, &ldquo;Why, what in the
      world has come over' you?&rdquo; It was the dress which Mr. Libby wore. He was a
      young fellow far too well made, and carried himself too alertly, to look
      as if any clothes misfitted him; his person gave their good cut elegance,
      but he had the effect of having fallen away in them. &ldquo;Why, you look as if
      you had been sick a month!&rdquo; Mrs. Maynard interpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man surveyed himself with a downward glance. &ldquo;They're
      Johnson's,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;He had them down for a hop at the Long Beach
      House, and sent over for them. I had nothing but my camping flannels, and
      they have n't been got into shape yet, since yesterday. I wanted to come
      over and see how you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Maynard. &ldquo;I never thought of you! How in the
      world did you get to your camp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I walked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In all that rain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I had been pretty well sprinkled, already. It was n't a question of
      wet and dry; it was a question of wet and wet. I was going off bareheaded,
      I lost my hat in the water, you know,&mdash;but your man, here, hailed me
      round the corner of the kitchen, and lent me one. I've been taking up
      collections of clothes ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Libby spoke lightly, and with a cry of &ldquo;Barlow's hat!&rdquo; Mrs. Maynard
      went off in a shriek of laughter; but a deep distress kept Grace silent.
      It seemed to her that she had been lacking not only in thoughtfulness, but
      in common humanity, in suffering him to walk away several miles in the
      rain, without making an offer to keep him and have him provided for in the
      house. She remembered now her bewildered impression that he was without a
      hat when he climbed the stairs and helped her to the house; she recalled
      the fact that she had thrust him on to the danger he had escaped, and her
      heart was melted with grief and shame. &ldquo;Mr. Libby&rdquo;&mdash;she began, going
      up to him, and drooping before him in an attitude which simply and frankly
      expressed the contrition she felt; but she could not continue. Mrs.
      Maynard's laugh broke into the usual cough, and as soon as she could speak
      she seized the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there, now; we can leave it to Mr. Libby. It's the principle of the
      thing that I look at. And I want to see how it strikes him. I want to
      know, Mr. Libby, if you were a doctor,&rdquo;&mdash;he looked at Grace, and
      flushed,&mdash;&ldquo;and a person was very sick, and wanted you to consult with
      another doctor, whether you would let the mere fact that you had n't been
      introduced have any weight with you?&rdquo; The young man silently appealed to
      Grace, who darkened angrily, and before he could speak Mrs. Maynard
      interposed. &ldquo;No, no, you sha'n't ask her. I want your opinion. It's just
      an abstract question.&rdquo; She accounted for this fib with a wink at Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it's rather formidable. I've never been a doctor of
      any kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, we know that!&rdquo; said Mrs. Maynard. &ldquo;But you are now, and now
      would you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the other fellow knew more, I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you thought he did n't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wouldn't. What are you trying to get at, Mrs. Maynard? I'm not
      going to answer any more of your questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;one more. Don't you think it's a doctor's place to get his
      patient well any way he can?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Grace! It's just exactly the same case. And ninety-nine out of a
      hundred would decide against you every time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Libby turned towards Grace in confusion. &ldquo;Miss Breen&mdash;I did n't
      understand&mdash;I don't presume to meddle in anything&mdash;You're not
      fair, Mrs. Maynard! I have n't any opinion on the subject, Miss Breen; I
      haven't, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can't back out, now!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Maynard joyously. &ldquo;You've
      said it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you're quite right, Mr. Libby,&rdquo; said Grace haughtily. She bade him
      good-morning; but he followed her from the room, and left Mrs. Maynard to
      her triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Breen&mdash;Do let me speak to you, please! Upon my word and honor,
      I didn't know what she was driving at; I did n't, indeed! It's pretty
      rough on me, for I never dreamt of setting myself up as a judge of your
      affairs. I know you're right, whatever you think; and I take it all back;
      it was got out of me by fraud, any way. And I beg your pardon for not
      calling you Doctor&mdash;if you want me to do it. The other comes more
      natural; but I wish to recognize you in the way you prefer, for I do feel
      most respectul&mdash;reverent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so very earnest and so really troubled, and he stumbled about so
      for the right word, and hit upon the wrong one with such unfailing
      disaster, that she must have been superhuman not to laugh. Her laughing
      seemed to relieve him even more than her hearty speech. &ldquo;Call me how you
      like, Mr. Libby. I don't insist upon anything with you; but I believe I
      prefer Miss Breen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're very kind! Miss Breen it is, then. And you'll, forgive my siding
      against you?&rdquo; he demanded radiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't speak of that again, please. I've nothing to forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked down-stairs and out on the piazza. Barlow stood before the
      steps, holding by the bit a fine bay mare, who twitched her head round a
      little at the sound of Libby's voice, and gave him a look. He passed
      without noticing the horse. &ldquo;I'm glad to find Mrs. Maynard so well. With
      that cold of hers, hanging on so long, I didn't know but she'd be in an
      awful state this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;it's a miraculous escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is I sent over to New Leyden for my team yesterday. I did n't
      know how things might turn out, and you're so far from a lemon here, that
      I thought I might be useful in going errands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace turned her head and glanced at the equipage. &ldquo;Is that your team?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the young fellow, with a smile of suppressed pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an exquisite creature!&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ISN'T she?&rdquo; They both faced about, and stood looking at the mare, and the
      light, shining, open buggy behind her. The sunshine had the after-storm
      glister; the air was brisk, and the breeze blew balm from the heart of the
      pine forest. &ldquo;Miss Breen,&rdquo; he broke out, &ldquo;I wish you'd take a little dash
      through the woods with me. I've got a broad-track buggy, that's just right
      for these roads. I don't suppose it's the thing at all to ask you, on such
      short acquaintance, but I wish you would. I know you'd enjoy it: Come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His joyous urgence gave her a strange thrill. She had long ceased to
      imagine herself the possible subject of what young ladies call attentions,
      and she did not think of herself in that way now. There was something in
      the frank, eager boyishness of the invitation that fascinated her, and the
      sunny face turned so hopefully upon her had its amusing eloquence. She
      looked about the place with an anxiety of which she was immediately
      ashamed: all the ladies were out of sight, and probably at the foot of the
      cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say no, Miss Breen,&rdquo; pleaded the gay voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer seemed to come of itself. &ldquo;Oh, thank you, yes, I should like to
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and the word which riveted her consent made her
      recoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not this morning. Some other day. I&mdash;I&mdash;I want to think
      about Mrs. Maynard. I&mdash;ought n't to leave her. Excuse me this
      morning, Mr. Libby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; he tried to say with unaltered gayety, but a note of
      disappointment made itself felt. &ldquo;Do you think she's going to be worse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't think she is. But&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, and waited a space
      before she continued. &ldquo;I 'm afraid I can't be of use to her any longer.
      She has lost confidence in me&mdash;It's important she should trust her
      physician.&rdquo; Libby blushed, as he always did when required to recognize
      Grace in her professional quality. &ldquo;It's more a matter of nerves than
      anything else, and if she does n't believe in me I can't do her any good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can understand that,&rdquo; said the young man, with gentle sympathy;
      and she felt, somehow, that he delicately refrained from any leading or
      prompting comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been urging me to have a consultation with some doctor about her
      case, and I&mdash;it would be ridiculous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I would n't do it!&rdquo; said Mr. Libby. &ldquo;You know a great deal better
      what she wants than she does. You had better make her, do what you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to burden you with my affairs,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;but I wished
      to explain her motive in speaking to you as she did.&rdquo; After she had said
      this, it seemed to her rather weak, and she could not think of anything
      else that would strengthen it. The young man might think that she had
      asked advice of him. She began to resent his telling her to make Mrs.
      Maynard do what she said. She was about to add something to snub him, when
      she recollected that it was her own wilfulness which had precipitated the
      present situation, and she humbled herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will probably change her mind,&rdquo; said Libby. &ldquo;She would if you could
      let her carry her point,&rdquo; he added, with a light esteem for Mrs. Maynard
      which set him wrong again in Grace's eyes: he had no business to speak so
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; she said, in stiff withdrawal from all terms of confidence
      concerning Mrs. Maynard. She did not add anything more, and she meant that
      the young fellow should perceive that his, audience was at an end. He did
      not apparently resent it, but she fancied him hurt in his acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back to her patient, whom she found languid and disposed to sleep
      after the recent excitement, and she left her again, taking little Bella
      with her. Mrs. Maynard slept long, but woke none the better for her nap.
      Towards evening she grew feverish, and her fever mounted as the night
      fell. She was restless and wakeful, and between her dreamy dozes she was
      incessant in her hints for a consultation to Grace, who passed the night
      in her room, and watched every change for the worse with a self-accusing
      heart. The impending trouble was in that indeterminate phase which must
      give the physician his most anxious moments; and this inexperienced girl;
      whose knowledge was all to be applied, and who had hardly arrived yet at
      that dismaying stage when a young physician finds all the results at war
      with all the precepts, began to realize the awfulness of her
      responsibility. She had always thought of saving life, and not of losing
      it.

      By morning Grace was as nervous and anxious as her patient, who had
      momentarily the advantage of her in having fallen asleep. She went
      stealthily out, and walked the length of the piazza, bathing her eyes with
      the sight of the sea, cool and dim under a clouded sky. At the corner next
      the kitchen she encountered Barlow, who, having kindled the fire for the
      cook, had spent s moment of leisure in killing some chickens at the barn;
      he appeared with a cluster of his victims in his hand, but at sight of
      Grace he considerately put them behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not noticed them. &ldquo;Mr. Barlow,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how far is it to
      Corbitant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barlow slouched into a conversational posture, easily resting on his
      raised hip the back of the hand in which he held the chickens. &ldquo;Well, it
      's accordin' to who you ask. Some says six mile, and real clever folks
      makes it about four and a quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you,&rdquo; persisted Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the last time I was there, I thought it was about sixty. 'Most
      froze my fingers goin' round the point. 'N' all I was afraid of was
      gettin' there too soon. Tell you, a lee shore ain't a pleasant neighbor in
      a regular old northeaster. 'F you go by land, I guess it's about ten mile
      round through the woods. Want to send for Dr. Mulbridge? I thought mebbe&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said Grace. She turned back into the house, and then she came
      running out again; but by this time Barlow had gone into the kitchen,
      where she heard him telling the cook that these were the last of the
      dommyneckers. At breakfast several of the ladies came and asked after Mrs.
      Maynard, whose restless night they had somehow heard of. When she came out
      of the dining-room' Miss Gleason waylaid her in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Breen,&rdquo; she said, in a repressed tumult, &ldquo;I hope you won't give way.
      For woman's sake, I hope you won't! You owe it to yourself not to give
      way! I'm sure Mrs. Maynard is as well off in your hands as she can be. If
      I did n't think so, I should be the last to advise your being firm; but,
      feeling as I do, I do advise it most strongly. Everything depends on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you mean, Miss Gleason,&rdquo; said Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad it hasn't come to you yet. If it was a question of mere
      professional pride, I should say, By all means call him at once. But I
      feel that a great deal more is involved. If you yield, you make it harder
      for other women to help themselves hereafter, and you confirm such people
      as these in their distrust of female physicians. Looking at it in a large
      way, I almost feel that it would be better for her to die than for you to
      give up; and feeling as I do&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you talking of Mrs. Maynard?&rdquo; asked Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all saying that you ought to give up the case to Dr. Mulbridge.
      But I hope you won't. I should n't blame you for calling in another female
      physician&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answered Grace. &ldquo;There is no danger of her dying. But it
      seems to me that she has too many female physicians already. In this house
      I should think it better to call a man.&rdquo; She left the barb to rankle in
      Miss Gleason's breast, and followed her mother to her room, who avenged
      Miss Gleason by a series of inquisitional tortures, ending with the hope
      that, whatever she did, Grace would not have that silly creature's blood
      on her hands. The girl opened her lips to attempt some answer to this
      unanswerable aspiration, when the unwonted sound of wheels on the road
      without caught her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, Grace?&rdquo; demanded her mother, as if Grace were guilty of the
      noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Libby,&rdquo; answered Grace, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he come for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. But I am going down to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At sight of the young man's face, Grace felt her heart lighten. He had
      jumped from his buggy, and was standing at his smiling ease on the piazza
      steps, looking about as if for some one, and he brightened joyfully at her
      coming. He took her hand with eager friendliness, and at her impulse began
      to move away to the end of the piazza with her. The ladies had not yet
      descended to the beach; apparently their interest in Dr. Breen's patient
      kept them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Mrs. Maynard this morning?&rdquo; he asked; and she answered, as they
      got beyond earshot,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not better, I'm afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm sorry,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;Then you won't be able to drive with
      me this morning? I hope she is n't seriously worse?&rdquo; he added, recurring
      to Mrs. Maynard at the sight of the trouble in Grace's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall ask to drive with you,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Mr. Libby, do you know
      where Corbitant is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you drive me there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly!&rdquo; he cried, in polite wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She turned half round, and cast a woman's look at the other
      women. &ldquo;I shall be ready in half an hour. Will you go away, and comeback
      then? Not sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything you please, Miss Breen,&rdquo; he said, laughing in his mystification.
      &ldquo;In thirty minutes, or thirty days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went back to the steps, and he mounted his buggy. She sat down, and
      taking some work from her pocket, bent her head over it. At first she was
      pale, and then she grew red. But these fluctuations of color could not
      keep her spectators long; one by one they dispersed and descended the
      cliff; and when she rose to go for her hat the last had vanished, with a
      longing look at her. It was Miss Gleason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace briefly announced her purpose to her mother, who said, &ldquo;I hope you
      are not doing anything impulsive&rdquo;; and she answered, &ldquo;No, I had quite made
      up my mind to it last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Libby had not yet returned when she went back to the piazza, and she
      walked out on the road by which he must arrive. She had not to walk far.
      He drew in sight before she had gone a quarter of a mile, driving rapidly.
      &ldquo;Am I late?&rdquo; he asked, turning, and pulling up at the roadside, with
      well-subdued astonishment at encountering her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; not that I know.&rdquo; She mounted to the seat, and they drove off in
      a silence which endured for a long time. If Libby had been as vain as he
      seemed light, he must have found it cruelly unflattering, for it ignored
      his presence and even his existence. She broke the silence at last with a
      deep-drawn sigh, as frankly sad as if she had been quite alone, but she
      returned to consciousness of him in it. &ldquo;Mr. Libby, you must think it is
      very strange for me to ask you to drive me to Corbitant without troubling
      myself to tell you my errand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I'm glad to be of use on any terms.
      It is n't often that one gets the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to see Dr. Mulbridge,&rdquo; she began, and then stopped so long
      that he perceived she wished him to say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I thought this morning that I should give Mrs. Maynard's case up to
      him. I shouldn't be at all troubled at seeming to give it up under a
      pressure of opinion, though I should not give it up for that. Of course,&rdquo;
       she explained, &ldquo;you don't know that all those women have been saying that
      I ought to call in Dr. Mulbridge. It's one of those things,&rdquo; she added
      bitterly, &ldquo;that make it so pleasant for a woman to try to help women.&rdquo; He
      made a little murmur of condolence, and she realized that she had thrown
      herself on his sympathy, when she thought she had been merely thinking
      aloud. &ldquo;What I mean is that he is a man of experience and reputation, and
      could probably be of more use to her than I, for she would trust him more.
      But I have known her a long time, and I understand her temperament and her
      character,&mdash;which goes for a good deal in such matters,&mdash;and I
      have concluded not to give up the case. I wish to meet Dr. Mulbridge,
      however, and ask him to see her in consultation with me. That is all,&rdquo; she
      ended rather haughtily, as if she had been dramatizing the fact to Dr.
      Mulbridge in her own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think that would be the right thing,&rdquo; said Libby limply, with
      uncalled-for approval; but he left this dangerous ground abruptly. &ldquo;As you
      say, character goes for a great deal in these things. I've seen Mrs.
      Maynard at the point of death before. As a general rule, she does n't die.
      If you have known her a long time, you know what I mean. She likes to
      share her sufferings with her friends. I've seen poor old Maynard&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Libby!&rdquo; Grace broke in. &ldquo;You may speak of Mr. Maynard as you like,
      but I cannot allow your disrespectfulness to Mrs. Maynard. It's shocking!
      You had no right to be their friend if you felt toward them as you seem to
      have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there was no harm in them. I liked them!&rdquo; explained the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People have no right to like those they don't respect!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Libby looked as if this were rather a new and droll idea. But he seemed
      not to object to her tutoring him. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as far as Mrs.
      Maynard was concerned, I don't know that I liked her any more than I
      respected her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace ought to have frowned at this, but she had to check a smile in.
      order to say gravely, &ldquo;I know she is disagreeable at times. And she likes
      to share her sufferings with others, as you say. But her husband was fully
      entitled to any share of them that he may have borne. If he had been
      kinder to her, she wouldn't be what and where she is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kinder to her!&rdquo; Libby exclaimed. &ldquo;He's the kindest fellow in the world!
      Now, Miss Breen,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;I hope Mrs. Maynard hasn't been
      talking against her husband to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; demanded Grace, &ldquo;that you don't know they're separated,
      and that she's going to take steps for a divorce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A divorce? No! What in the world for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never talk gossip. I thought of course she had told you&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never told me a word! She was ashamed to do it! She knows that I know
      Maynard was the best husband in the world to her. All she told me was that
      he was out on his ranch, and she had come on here for her health. It's
      some ridiculous little thing that no reasonable woman would have dreamt of
      caring for. It's one of her caprices. It's her own fickleness. She's tired
      of him,&mdash;or thinks she is, and that's all about it. Miss Breen, I beg
      you won't believe anything against Maynard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; faltered Grace, astonished at his fervor; and the
      light it cast upon her first doubts of him. &ldquo;Of course, I only know the
      affair from her report, and I haven't concerned myself in it, except as it
      affected her health. And I don't wish to misjudge him. And I like your&mdash;defending
      him,&rdquo; she said, though it instantly seemed a patronizing thing to have
      said. &ldquo;But I couldn't withhold my sympathy where I believed there had been
      neglect and systematic unkindness, and finally desertion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know Mrs. Maynard; I know her kind of talk. I've seen Maynard's
      neglect and unkindness, and I know just what his desertion would be. If
      he's left her, it's because she wanted him to leave her; he did it to
      humor her, to please her. I shall have a talk with Mrs. Maynard when we
      get back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'm afraid I can't allow it at present,&rdquo; said Grace, very seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is worse to-day. Otherwise I should n't be giving you this trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's no trouble&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;But I'm glad&mdash;I'm glad we've had this
      understanding. I'm very glad. It makes me think worse of myself and better
      of&mdash;others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Libby gave a laugh. &ldquo;And you like that? You're easily pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remained grave. &ldquo;I ought to be able to tell you what I mean. But it is
      n't possible&mdash;now. Will you let me beg your pardon?&rdquo; she urged, with
      impulsive earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he answered, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not ask me why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Yes,&rdquo; she added hastily, &ldquo;she is so much worse that some one
      of greater experience than I must see her, and I have made up my mind. Dr.
      Mulbridge may refuse to consult with me. I know very well that there is a
      prejudice against women physicians, and I couldn't especially blame him
      for sharing it. I have thought it all over. If he refuses, I shall know
      what to do.&rdquo; She had ceased to address Libby, who respected her soliloquy.
      He drove on rapidly over the soft road, where the wheels made no sound,
      and the track wandered with apparent aimlessness through the interminable
      woods of young oak and pine. The low trees were full of the sunshine, and
      dappled them with shadow as they dashed along; the fresh, green ferns
      springing from the brown carpet of the pine-needles were as if painted
      against it. The breath of the pines was heavier for the recent rain; and
      the woody smell of the oaks was pungent where the balsam failed. They met
      no one, but the solitude did not make itself felt through her
      preoccupation. From time to time she dropped a word or two; but for the
      most she was silent, and he did not attempt to lead. By and by they came
      to an opener place, where there were many red field-lilies tilting in the
      wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like some of those?&rdquo; he asked, pulling up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should, very much,&rdquo; she answered, glad of the sight of the gay things.
      But when he had gathered her a bunch of the flowers she looked down at
      them in her lap, and said, &ldquo;It's silly in me to be caring for lilies at
      such a time, and I should make an unfavorable impression on Dr. Mulbridge
      if he saw me with them. But I shall risk their effect on him. He may think
      I have been botanizing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless you tell him you have n't,&rdquo; the young man suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need n't do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think any one else would do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She colored a little at the tribute to her candor, and it pleased her,
      though it had just pleased her as much to forget that she was not like any
      other young girl who might be simply and irresponsibly happy in flowers
      gathered for her by a young man. &ldquo;I won't tell him, either!&rdquo; she cried,
      willing to grasp the fleeting emotion again; but it was gone, and only a
      little residue of sad consciousness remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woods gave way on either side of the road, which began to be a village
      street, sloping and shelving down toward the curve of a quiet bay. The
      neat weather-gray dwellings, shingled to the ground and brightened with
      door-yard flowers and creepers, straggled off into the boat-houses and
      fishing-huts on the shore, and the village seemed to get afloat at last in
      the sloops and schooners riding in the harbor, whose smooth plane rose
      higher to the eye than the town itself. The salt and the sand were
      everywhere, but though there had been no positive prosperity in Corbitant
      for a generation, the place had an impregnable neatness, which defied
      decay; if there had been a dog in the street, there would not have been a
      stick to throw at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the better, but not the best, of the village houses, which did not
      differ from the others in any essential particular, and which stood flush
      upon the street, bore a door-plate with the name Dr. Rufus Mulbridge, and
      Libby drew up in front of it without having had to alarm the village with
      inquiries. Grace forbade his help in dismounting, and ran to the door,
      where she rang one of those bells which sharply respond at the back of the
      panel to the turn of a crank in front; she observed, in a difference of
      paint, that this modern improvement had displaced an old-fashioned
      knocker. The door was opened by a tall and strikingly handsome old woman,
      whose black eyes still kept their keen light under her white hair, and
      whose dress showed none of the incongruity which was offensive in the
      door-bell: it was in the perfection of an antiquated taste, which,
      however, came just short of characterizing it with gentle womanliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Dr. Mulbridge at home?&rdquo; asked Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other, with a certain hesitation, and holding the door
      ajar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see him,&rdquo; said Grace, mounting to the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it important?&rdquo; asked the elder woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; replied Grace, with an accent at once of surprise and decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may come in,&rdquo; said the other reluctantly, and she opened a door into
      a room at the side of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may give Dr. Mulbridge my card, if you please,&rdquo; said Grace, before
      she turned to go into this room; and the other took it, and left her to
      find a chair for herself. It was a country doctor's office, with the usual
      country doctor's supply of drugs on a shelf, but very much more than the
      country doctor's usual library: the standard works were there, and there
      were also the principal periodicals and the latest treatises of note in
      the medical world. In a long, upright case, like that of an old
      hall-clock, was the anatomy of one who had long done with time; a
      laryngoscope and some other professional apparatus of constant utility lay
      upon the leaf of the doctor's desk. There was nothing in the room which
      did not suggest his profession, except the sword and the spurs which hung
      upon the wall opposite where Grace sat beside one of the front windows.
      She spent her time in study of the room and its appointments, and in now
      and then glancing out at Mr. Libby, who sat statuesquely patient in the
      buggy. His profile cut against the sky was blameless; and a humorous
      shrewdness which showed in the wrinkle at his eye and in the droop of his
      yellow mustache gave its regularity life and charm. It occurred to her
      that if Dr. Mulbridge caught sight of Mr. Libby before he saw her, or
      before she could explain that she had got one of the gentlemen at the
      hotel&mdash;she resolved upon this prevarication&mdash;to drive her to
      Corbitant in default of another conveyance, he would have his impressions
      and conjectures, which doubtless the bunch of lilies in her hand would do
      their part to stimulate. She submitted to this possibility, and waited for
      his coming, which began to seem unreasonably delayed. The door opened at
      last, and a tall, powerfully framed man of thirty-five or forty, dressed
      in an ill-fitting suit of gray Canada homespun appeared. He moved with a
      slow, pondering step, and carried his shaggy head bent downwards from
      shoulders slightly rounded. His dark beard was already grizzled, and she
      saw that his mustache was burnt and turned tawny at points by smoking, of
      which habit his presence gave stale evidence to another sense. He held
      Grace's card in his hand, and he looked at her, as he advanced, out of
      gray eyes that, if not sympathetic, were perfectly intelligent, and that
      at once sought to divine and class her. She perceived that he took in the
      lilies and her coming color; she felt that he noted her figure and her
      dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She half rose in response to his questioning bow, and he motioned her to
      her seat again. &ldquo;I had to keep you waiting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was up all night
      with a patient, and I was asleep when my mother called me.&rdquo; He stopped
      here, and definitively waited for her to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not find this easy, as he took a chair in front of her, and sat
      looking steadily in her face. &ldquo;I'm sorry to have disturbed you&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, not
      at all,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;The rule is to disturb a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; she began again, &ldquo;that I am not sure that I am justified in
      disturbing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited a little while for her to go on, and then he said, &ldquo;Well, let us
      hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to consult with you,&rdquo; she broke out, and again she came to a
      sudden pause; and as she looked into his vigilant face, in which she was
      not sure there was not a hovering derision, she could not continue. She
      felt that she ought to gather courage from the fact that he had not
      started, or done anything positively disagreeable when she had asked for a
      consultation; but she could not, and it did not avail her to reflect that
      she was rendering herself liable to all conceivable misconstruction,&mdash;that
      she was behaving childishly, with every appearance of behaving guiltily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to her aid again, in a blunt fashion, neither kind nor unkind, but
      simply common sense. &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What are the symptoms? Where and how are, you sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sick,&rdquo; she cried. They stared at each other in reciprocal
      amazement and mystification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then excuse me if I ask you what you wish me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Grace, realizing his natural error, with a flush. &ldquo;It is n't in
      regard to myself that I wish to consult with you. It's another person&mdash;a
      friend&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dr. Mulbridge, laughing, with the impatience of a physician
      used to making short cuts through the elaborate and reluctant statements
      of ladies seeking advice, &ldquo;what is the matter with your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been an invalid for some time,&rdquo; replied Grace. The laugh, which
      had its edge of patronage and conceit, stung her into self-possession
      again, and she briefly gave the points of Mrs. Maynard's case, with the
      recent accident and the symptoms developed during the night. He listened
      attentively, nodding his head at times, and now and then glancing sharply
      at her, as one might at a surprisingly intelligent child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see her,&rdquo; he said decidedly, when she came to an end. &ldquo;I will see
      her as soon as possible. I will come over to Jocelyn's this afternoon,&mdash;as
      soon as I can get my dinner, in fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was such a tone of dismissal in his words that she rose, and he
      promptly followed her example. She stood hesitating a moment. Then, &ldquo;I
      don't know whether you understood that I wish merely to consult with you,&rdquo;
       she said; &ldquo;that I don't wish to relinquish the case to you&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Relinquish the case&mdash;consult&rdquo;&mdash;Dr. Mulbridge stared at her.
      &ldquo;No, I don't understand. What do you mean by not relinquishing the case?
      If there is some one else in attendance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in attendance,&rdquo; said the girl firmly. &ldquo;I am Mrs. Maynard's
      physician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? Physician&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have looked at my card&rdquo;&mdash;she began with indignant severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a sort of roar of amusement and apology, and then he stared at her
      again with much of the interest of a naturalist in an extraordinary
      specimen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I did n't look at it&rdquo;; but he now did
      so, where he held it crumpled in the palm of his left hand. &ldquo;My mother
      said it was a young lady, and I did n't look. Will you will you sit down,
      Dr. Breen?&rdquo; He bustled in getting her several chairs. &ldquo;I live off here in
      a corner, and I have never happened to meet any ladies of our profession
      before. Excuse me, if I spoke under a&mdash;mistaken impression. I&mdash;I&mdash;I
      should not have&mdash;ah&mdash;taken you for a physician. You&rdquo;&mdash;He
      checked himself, as if he might have been going to say that she was too
      young and too pretty. &ldquo;Of course, I shall have pleasure in consulting with
      you in regard to your friend's case, though I've no doubt you are doing
      all that can be done.&rdquo; With a great show of deference, he still betrayed
      something of the air of one who humors a joke; and she felt this, but felt
      that she could not openly resent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she returned with dignity, indicating with a gesture of her
      hand that she would not sit down again. &ldquo;I am sorry to ask you to come so
      far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all. I shall be driving over in that direction at any rate.
      I've a patient near there.&rdquo; He smiled upon her with frank curiosity, and
      seemed willing to detain her, but at a loss how to do so. &ldquo;If I had n't
      been stupid from my nap I should have inferred a scientific training from
      your statement of your friend's case.&rdquo; She still believed that he was
      laughing at her, and that this was a mock but she was still helpless to
      resent it, except by an assumption of yet colder state. This had
      apparently no effect upon Dr. Mulbridge. He continued to look at her with
      hardly concealed amusement, and visibly to grow more and more conscious of
      her elegance and style, now that she stood before him. There had been a
      time when, in planning her career, she had imagined herself studying a
      masculine simplicity and directness of address; but the over-success of
      some young women, her fellows at the school, in this direction had
      disgusted her with it, and she had perceived that after all there is
      nothing better for a girl, even a girl who is a doctor of medicine, than a
      ladylike manner. Now, however, she wished that she could do or say
      something aggressively mannish, for she felt herself dwindling away to the
      merest femininity, under a scrutiny which had its fascination, whether
      agreeable or disagreeable. &ldquo;You must,&rdquo; he said, with really unwarrantable
      patronage, &ldquo;have found that the study of medicine has its difficulties,&mdash;you
      must have been very strongly drawn to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, not at all; I had rather an aversion at first,&rdquo; she replied, with
      the instant superiority of a woman where the man suffers any topic to
      become personal. &ldquo;Why did you think I was drawn to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;I don't know that I thought so,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I
      believe I intended to ask,&rdquo; he added bluntly; but she had the satisfaction
      of seeing him redden, and she did not volunteer anything in his relief.
      She divined that it would leave him with an awkward sense of defeat if he
      quitted the subject there; and in fact he had determined that he would
      not. &ldquo;Some of our ladies take up the study abroad,&rdquo; he said; and he went
      on to speak, with a real deference, of the eminent woman who did the
      American name honor by the distinction she achieved in the schools of
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been abroad,&rdquo; said Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought all American ladies had been abroad&rdquo;; and
      now he said, with easy recognition of her resolution not to help him out,
      &ldquo;I suppose you have your diploma from the Philadelphia school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;from the New York school,&mdash;the homoeopathic
      school of New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mulbridge instantly sobered, and even turned a little pale, but he did
      not say anything. He remained looking at her as if she had suddenly
      changed from a piquant mystery to a terrible dilemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved toward the door. &ldquo;Then I may expect you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;about the
      middle of the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply; he stumbled upon the chairs in following her a pace or
      two, with a face of acute distress. Then he broke out with &ldquo;I can't come!
      I can't consult with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and looked at him with astonishment, which he did his best to
      meet. Her astonishment congealed into hauteur, and then dissolved into the
      helplessness of a lady who has been offered a rudeness; but still she did
      not speak. She merely looked at him, while he halted and stammered on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Personally, I&mdash;I&mdash;should be&mdash;obliged&mdash;I should feel
      honored&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;It has nothing to do with your&mdash;your&mdash;being
      a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;woman lady. I should not care for that. No. But
      surely you must know the reasons&mdash;the obstacles&mdash;which deter
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't,&rdquo; she said, calm with the advantage of his perturbation. &ldquo;But
      if you refuse, that is sufficient. I will not inquire your reasons. I will
      simply withdraw my request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. But I beg you to understand that they have no reference
      whatever to you in&mdash;your own&mdash;capacity&mdash;character&mdash;individual
      quality. They are purely professional&mdash;that is, technical&mdash;I
      should say disciplinary,&mdash;entirely disciplinary. Yes, disciplinary.&rdquo;
       The word seemed to afford Dr. Mulbridge the degree of relief which can
      come only from an exactly significant and luminously exegetic word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't at all know what you mean,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;But it is not necessary
      that I should know. Will you allow me?&rdquo; she asked, for Dr. Mulbridge had
      got between her and the door, and stood with his hand on the latch.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face flushed, and drops stood on his forehead. &ldquo;Surely, Miss&mdash;I
      mean Doctor&mdash;Breen, you must know why I can't consult with you! We
      belong to two diametrically opposite schools&mdash;theories&mdash;of
      medicine. It would be impracticable&mdash;impossible for us to consult. We
      could find no common ground. Have you never heard that the&mdash;ah
      regular practice cannot meet homoeopathists in this way? If you had told
      me&mdash;if I had known&mdash;you were a homoeopathist, I could n't have
      considered the matter at all. I can't now express any opinion as to your
      management of the case, but I have no doubt that you will know what to do&mdash;from
      your point of view&mdash;and that you will prefer to call in some one of
      your own&mdash;persuasion. I hope that you don't hold me personally
      responsible for this result!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; replied the girl, with a certain dreamy abstraction. &ldquo;I had
      heard that you made some such distinction&mdash;I remember, now. But I
      could n't realize anything so ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mulbridge colored. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if, even under the
      circumstances, I can't agree with you that the position taken by the
      regular practice is ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not make any direct reply. &ldquo;But I supposed that you only made this
      distinction, as you call it, in cases where there is no immediate danger;
      that in a matter of life and death you would waive it. Mrs. Maynard is
      really&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no conditions under which I could not conscientiously refuse to
      waive it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried Grace, &ldquo;I withdraw the word! It is not ridiculous. It is
      monstrous, atrocious, inhuman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light of humorous irony glimmered in Dr. Mulbridge's eye. &ldquo;I must submit
      to your condemnation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn't a personal condemnation!&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I have no doubt
      that personally you are not responsible. We can lay aside our distinctions
      as allopathist and homoeopathist, and you can advise with me&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's quite impossible,&rdquo; said Dr. Mulbridge. &ldquo;If I advised with you, I
      might be&mdash;A little while ago one of our school in Connecticut was
      expelled from the State Medical Association for consulting with&rdquo;&mdash;he
      began to hesitate, as if he had not hit upon a fortunate or appropriate
      illustration, but he pushed on&mdash;&ldquo;with his own wife, who was a
      physician of your school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She haughtily ignored his embarrassment. &ldquo;I can appreciate your
      difficulty, and pity any liberal-minded person who is placed as you are,
      and disapproves of such wretched bigotry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am obliged to tell you,&rdquo; said Dr. Mulbridge, &ldquo;that I don't disapprove
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am detaining you,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;I beg your pardon. I was curious to
      know how far superstition and persecution can go in our day.&rdquo; If the
      epithets were not very accurate, she used them with a woman's
      effectiveness, and her intention made them descriptive. &ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; she
      added, and she made a movement toward the door, from which Dr. Mulbridge
      retired. But she did not open the door. Instead, she sank into the chair
      which stood in the corner, and passed her hand over her forehead, as if
      she were giddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mulbridge's finger was instantly on her wrist. &ldquo;Are you faint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she gasped, pulling her hand away. &ldquo;I am perfectly well.&rdquo; Then
      she was silent for a time before she added by a supreme effort, &ldquo;I have no
      right to endanger another's life, through any miserable pride, and I never
      will. Mrs. Maynard needs greater experience than mine, and she must have
      it. I can't justify myself in the delay and uncertainty of sending to
      Boston. I relinquish the case. I give it to you. And I will nurse her
      under your direction, obediently, conscientiously. Oh!&rdquo; she cried, at his
      failure to make any immediate response, &ldquo;surely you won't refuse to take
      the case!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't refuse,&rdquo; he said, with an effect of difficult concession. &ldquo;I will
      come. I will drive over at once, after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose now, and put her hand on the door-latch. &ldquo;Do you object to my
      nursing your patient? She is an old school friend. But I could yield that
      point too, if&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no! I shall be only too glad of your help, and your&rdquo;&mdash;he was
      going to say advice, but he stopped himself, and repeated&mdash;&ldquo;help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood inconclusively a moment, as if they would both be glad of
      something more to say. Then she said tentatively, &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; and he
      responded experimentally, &ldquo;Good-morning&rdquo;; and with that they involuntarily
      parted, and she went out of the door, which he stood holding open even
      after she had got out of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother came down the stairs. &ldquo;What in the world were you quarrelling
      with that girl about, Rufus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were not quarrelling, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it sounded like it. Who was she?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; repeated her son absently. &ldquo;Dr. Breen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Breen? That girl a doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought she was some saucy thing. Well, upon my word!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
      Mulbridge. &ldquo;So that is a female doctor, is it? Was she sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said her son, with what she knew to be professional finality.
      &ldquo;Mother, if you can hurry dinner a little, I shall be glad. I have to
      drive over to Jocelyn's, and I should like to start as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the young man with her? Her beau, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there a young man with her?&rdquo; asked Dr. Mulbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother went out without speaking. She could be unsatisfactory, too.

      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No one but Mrs. Breen knew of her daughter's errand, and when Grace came
      back she alighted from Mr. Libby's buggy with an expression of thanks that
      gave no clew as to the direction or purpose of it. He touched his hat to
      her with equal succinctness, and drove away, including all the ladies on
      the piazza in a cursory obeisance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must ask you, Miss Gleason,&rdquo; said Mrs. Alger. &ldquo;Your admiration of Dr.
      Breen clothes you with authority and responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't understand it at all,&rdquo; Miss Gleason confessed. &ldquo;But I'm sure
      there's nothing in it. He isn't her equal. She would feel that it wasn't
      right&mdash;under the circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if Mrs. Maynard was well it would be a fair game, you mean,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Alger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Miss Gleason, with the greatest air of candor, &ldquo;I can't
      admit that I meant that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the elder lady, &ldquo;the presumption is against them. Every young
      couple seen together must be considered in love till they prove the
      contrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like it in her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost. &ldquo;It shows that she is human, after
      all. It shows that she is like other girls. It's a relief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is n't like other girls,&rdquo; contended Miss Gleason darkly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather have Mr. Libby's opinion,&rdquo; said Mrs. Merritt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace went to Mrs. Maynard's room, and told her that Dr. Mulbridge was
      coming directly after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would do it!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maynard, throwing her right arm round
      Grace's neck, while the latter bent over to feel the pulse in her left. &ldquo;I
      knew where you had gone as soon as your mother told me you had driven off
      with Walter Libby. I'm so glad that you've got somebody to consult! Your
      theories are perfectly right and I'm sure that Dr. Mulbridge will just
      tell you to keep on as you've been doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace withdrew from her caress. &ldquo;Dr. Mulbridge is not coming for a
      consultation. He refused to consult with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Refused to consult? Why, how perfectly ungentlemanly! Why did he refuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he is an allopathist and I am a homoeopathist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, what is he coming for, I should like to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given up the case to him,&rdquo; said Grace wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maynard, &ldquo;I won't be given up. I will simply
      die! Not a pill, not a powder, of his will I touch! If he thinks himself
      too good to consult with another doctor, and a lady at that, merely
      because she doesn't happen to be allopathist, he can go along! I never
      heard of anything so conceited, so disgustingly mean, in my life. No,
      Grace! Why, it's horrid!&rdquo; She was silent, and then, &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; she
      added, &ldquo;if he comes, I shall have to see him. I look like a fright, I
      suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do your hair,&rdquo; said Grace, with indifference to these vows and
      protests; and without deigning further explanation or argument she made
      the invalid's toilet for her. If given time, Mrs. Maynard would talk
      herself into any necessary frame of mind, and Grace merely supplied the
      monosyllabic promptings requisite for her transition from mood to mood. It
      was her final resolution that when Dr. Mulbridge did come she should give
      him a piece of her mind; and she received him with anxious submissiveness,
      and hung upon all his looks and words with quaking and with an inclination
      to attribute her unfavorable symptoms to the treatment of her former
      physician. She did not spare him certain apologies for the disorderly
      appearance of her person and her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace sat by and watched him with perfectly quiescent observance. The
      large, somewhat uncouth man gave evidence to her intelligence that he was
      all physician&mdash;that he had not chosen his profession from any theory
      or motive, however good, but had been as much chosen by it as if he had
      been born a Physician. He was incredibly gentle and soft in all his
      movements, and perfectly kind, without being at any moment unprofitably
      sympathetic. He knew when to listen and when not to listen,&mdash;to learn
      everything from the quivering bundle of nerves before him without seeming
      to have learnt anything alarming; he smiled when it would do her good to
      be laughed at, and treated her with such grave respect that she could not
      feel herself trifled with, nor remember afterwards any point of neglect.
      When he rose and left some medicines, with directions to Grace for giving
      them and instructions for contingencies, she followed him from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Maynard is threatened with pneumonia. Or, I don't know why I should
      say threatened,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;she has pneumonia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I supposed&mdash;I was afraid so,&rdquo; faltered the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He looked into her eyes with even more seriousness than he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she friends here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; her husband is in Cheyenne, out on the plains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to know,&rdquo; said Dr. Mulbridge. &ldquo;A great deal will depend upon her
      nursing&mdash;Miss&mdash;ah&mdash;Dr. Breen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need n't call me Dr. Breen,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;At present, I am Mrs.
      Maynard's nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ignored this as he had ignored every point connected with the interview
      of the morning. He repeated the directions he had already given with still
      greater distinctness, and, saying that he should come in the morning,
      drove away. She went back to Louise: inquisition for inquisition, it was
      easier to meet that of her late patient than that of her mother, and for
      once the girl spared herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he thought I was very bad,&rdquo; whimpered Mrs. Maynard, for a
      beginning. &ldquo;What is the matter with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cold has taken an acute form; you will have to go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I 'm going to be down sick! I knew I was! I knew it! And what am I
      going to do, off in such a place as this? No one to nurse me, or look
      after Bella! I should think you would be satisfied now, Grace, with the
      result of your conscientiousness: you were so very sure that Mr. Libby was
      wanting to flirt with me that you drove us to our death, because you
      thought he felt guilty and was trying to fib out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let me help to undress you?&rdquo; asked Grace gently. &ldquo;Bella shall be
      well taken care of, and I am going to nurse you myself, under Dr.
      Mulbridge's direction. And once for all, Louise, I wish to say that I hold
      myself to blame for all&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Much good that does now!&rdquo; Being got into bed, with the sheet
      smoothed under her chin, she said, with the effect of drawing a strictly
      logical conclusion from the premises, &ldquo;Well, I should think George Maynard
      would want to be with his family!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spent with this ordeal, Grace left her at last, and went out on the
      piazza, where she found Libby returned. In fact, he had, upon second
      thoughts, driven back, and put up his horse at Jocelyn's, that he might be
      of service there in case he were needed. The ladies, with whom he had been
      making friends, discreetly left him to Grace, when she appeared, and she
      frankly walked apart with him, and asked him if he could go over to New
      Leyden, and telegraph to Mr. Maynard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she asked for him?&rdquo; he inquired, laughing. &ldquo;I knew it would come to
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has not asked; she has said that she thought he ought to be with his
      family,&rdquo; repeated Grace faithfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know how she said it: as if he had gone away wilfully, and kept
      away against her wishes and all the claims of honor and duty. It wouldn't
      take her long to get round to that if she thought she was very sick. Is
      she so bad?&rdquo; he inquired, with light scepticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's threatened with pneumonia. We can't tell how bad she may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course I'll telegraph. But I don't think anything serious can be
      the matter with Mrs. Maynard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Mulbridge said that Mr. Maynard ought to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; asked Libby, in quite a different tone. If she recognized
      the difference, she was meekly far from resenting it; he, however, must
      have wished to repair his blunder. &ldquo;I think you need n't have given up the
      case to him. I think you're too conscientious about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't speak of that now,&rdquo; she interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I won't,&rdquo; he consented. &ldquo;Can I be of any use here to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we shall need nothing more. The doctor will be here again in the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Libby did not come in the morning till after the doctor had gone, and
      then he explained that he had waited to hear in reply to his telegram, so
      that they might tell Mrs. Maynard her husband had started; and he had only
      just now heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has he started?&rdquo; Grace asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard from his partner. Maynard was at the ranch. His partner had gone
      for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he will soon be here,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will, if telegraphing can bring him. I sat up half the night with the
      operator. She was very obliging when she understood the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She?&rdquo; reputed Grace, with a slight frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The operators are nearly all women in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; She looked grave. &ldquo;Can they trust young girls with such important
      duties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did n't in this instance,&rdquo; relied Libby. &ldquo;She was a pretty old girl.
      What made you think she was young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I thought you said she was young.&rdquo; She blushed, and seemed
      about to say more, but she did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited, and then he said, &ldquo;You can tell Mrs. Maynard that I telegraphed
      on my own responsibility, if you think it's going to alarm her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Grace, with a helpless sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't like to tell her that,&rdquo; he suggested, after a moment, in which
      he had watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know. And some day I will tell you how&mdash;if you will let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a question; and she did not know what it was that kept her&mdash;silent
      and breathless and hot in the throat. &ldquo;I don't like to do it,&rdquo; she said at
      last. &ldquo;I hate myself whenever I have to feign anything. I knew perfectly
      well that you did n't say she was young,&rdquo; she broke out desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say Mrs. Maynard was young?&rdquo; he asked stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried. She rose hastily from the bench where she had been
      sitting with him. &ldquo;I must go back to her now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He mounted to his buggy, and drove thoughtfully away at a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies, whose excited sympathies for Mrs. Maynard had kept them from
      the beach till now, watched him quite out of sight before they began to
      talk of Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Dr. Breen's new patient will be more tractable,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Merritt. &ldquo;It would be a pity if she had to give him up, too, to Dr.
      Mulbridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Scott failed of the point. &ldquo;Why, is Mr. Libby sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Merritt, with a titter of self-applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be sorry,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Alger authoritatively, &ldquo;if we had
      said anything to influence the poor thing in what she has done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't think we need distress ourselves about undue influence!&rdquo; Mrs.
      Merritt exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Alger chose to ignore the suggestion. &ldquo;She had a very difficult part;
      and I think she has acted courageously. I always feel sorry for girls who
      attempt anything of that kind. It's a fearful ordeal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they say Miss Breen was n't obliged to do it for a living,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Scott suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse,&rdquo; said Mrs. Merritt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, so much the better,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Alger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Merritt, sitting on the edge of the piazza, stooped over with
      difficulty and plucked a glass-straw, which she bit as she looked
      rebelliously away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Frost had installed herself as favorite since Mrs. Alger had praised
      her hair. She now came forward, and, dropping fondly at her knee, looked
      up to her for instruction. &ldquo;Don't you think that she showed her sense in
      giving up at the very beginning, if she found she was n't equal to it?&rdquo;
       She gave her head a little movement from side to side, and put the mass of
      her back hair more on show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mrs. Alger, looking at the favorite not very favorably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't think she's given up,&rdquo; Miss Gleason interposed, in her
      breathless manner. She waited to be asked why, and then she added, &ldquo;I
      think she's acting in consultation with Dr. Mulbridge. He may have a
      certain influence over her,&mdash;I think he has; but I know they are
      acting in unison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Merritt flung her grass-straw away. &ldquo;Perhaps it is to be Dr.
      Mulbridge, after all, and not Mr. Libby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of that,&rdquo; Miss Gleason assented candidly. &ldquo;Yes, I have
      thought of that. I have thought of their being constantly thrown together,
      in this way. It would not discourage me. She could be quite as true to her
      vocation as if she remained single. Truer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking of true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Scott, &ldquo;always does make me think of blue.
      They say that yellow will be worn on everything this winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old gold?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Frost. &ldquo;Yes, more than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; cried the other lady. &ldquo;I don't know what I shall do. It perfectly
      kills my hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Gleason!&rdquo; exclaimed the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe in character coming out in color?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly. I have always believed that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've got a friend, and she wouldn't have anything to do with a girl
      that wore magenta more than she would fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should suppose,&rdquo; explained Miss Gleason, &ldquo;that all those aniline dyes
      implied something coarse in people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is n't it curious,&rdquo; asked Mrs. Frost, &ldquo;how red-haired people have come in
      fashion? I can recollect, when I was a little girl, that everybody laughed
      at red hair. There was one girl at the first school I ever went to,&mdash;the
      boys used to pretend to burn their fingers at her hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Dr. Breen's hair is a very pretty shade of brown,&rdquo; said the young
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Merritt rose from the edge of the piazza. &ldquo;I think that if she hasn't
      given up to him entirely she's the most submissive consulting physician I
      ever saw,&rdquo; she said, and walked out over the grass towards the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies looked after her. &ldquo;Is Mrs. Merritt more pudgy when she's
      sitting down or when she's standing up?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Scott.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Gleason seized her first chance of speaking with Grace alone. &ldquo;Oh, do
      you know how much you are doing for us all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doing for you, all? How doing?&rdquo; faltered Grace, whom she had whisperingly
      halted in a corner of the hall leading from the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By acting in unison,&mdash;by solving the most perplexing problem in
      women's practising your profession. She passed the edge of her fan over
      her lips before letting it fall furled upon her left hand, and looked
      luminously into Grace's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't at all know what you mean, Miss Gleason,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Gleason kicked out the skirt of her dress, so as to leave herself
      perfectly free for the explanation. &ldquo;Practising in harmony with a
      physician of the other sex. I have always felt that there was the great
      difficulty,&mdash;how to bring that about. I have always felt that the
      TRUE physician must be DUAL,&mdash;have both the woman's nature and the
      man's; the woman's tender touch, the man's firm grasp. You have shown how
      the medical education of women can meet this want. The physician can
      actually be dual,&mdash;be two, in fact. Hereafter, I have no doubt we
      shall always call a physician of each sex. But it's wonderful how you
      could ever bring it about, though you can do anything! Has n't it worn
      upon you?&rdquo; Miss Gleason darted out her sentences in quick, short breaths,
      fixing Grace with her eyes, and at each clause nervously tapping her chest
      with her reopened fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you suppose,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;that Dr. Mulbridge and I are acting
      professionally in unison, as you call it, you are mistaken. He has entire
      charge of the case; I gave it up to him, and I am merely nursing Mrs.
      Maynard under his direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How splendid!&rdquo; Miss Gleason exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you know that I admire you for
      giving up,&mdash;for knowing when to give up? So few women do that! Is n't
      he magnificent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magnificent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean psychically. He is what I should call a strong soul You must have
      felt his masterfulness; you must have enjoyed it! Don't you like to be
      dominated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;I should n't at all like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do! I like to meet one of those forceful masculine natures that
      simply bid you obey. It's delicious. Such a sense of self-surrender,&rdquo; Miss
      Gleason explained. &ldquo;It is n't because they are men,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I have
      felt the same influence from some women. I felt it, in a certain degree,
      on first meeting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; said Grace coldly. &ldquo;I should dislike being controlled
      myself, and I should dislike still more to control others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're doing it now!&rdquo; cried Miss Gleason, with delight. &ldquo;I could not do a
      thing to resist your putting me down! Of course you don't know that you're
      doing it; it's purely involuntary. And you wouldn't know that he was
      dominating you. And he would n't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very probably Dr. Mulbridge would not have recognized himself in the
      character of all-compelling lady's-novel hero, which Miss Gleason imagined
      for him. Life presented itself rather simply to him, as it does to most
      men, and he easily dismissed its subtler problems from a mind preoccupied
      with active cares. As far as Grace was concerned, she had certainly roused
      in him an unusual curiosity; nothing less than her homoeopathy would have
      made him withdraw his consent to a consultation with her, and his fear had
      been that in his refusal she should escape from his desire to know more
      about her, her motives, her purposes. He had accepted without scruple the
      sacrifice of pride she had made to him; but he had known how to appreciate
      her scientific training, which he found as respectable as that of any
      clever, young man of their profession. He praised, in his way, the
      perfection with which she interpreted his actions and intentions in regard
      to the patient. &ldquo;If there were such nurses as you, Miss Breen, there would
      be very little need of doctors,&rdquo; he said, with a sort of interogative
      fashion of laughing peculiar to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of being a nurse once;&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Perhaps I may still be
      one. The scientific training won't be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no? It's a pity that more of them have n't it. But I suppose they
      think nursing is rather too humble an ambition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it so,&rdquo; said Grace briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you did n't care for medical distinction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her quizzically, as if this were much droller than if she had
      cared. &ldquo;I don't understand why you should have gone into it. You told me,
      I think, that it was repugnant to you; and it's hard work for a woman, and
      very uncertain work for anyone. You must have had a tremendous desire to
      benefit your race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His characterization of her motive was so distasteful that she made no
      reply, and left him to his conjectures, in which he did not appear
      unhappy. &ldquo;How do you find Mrs. Maynard to-day?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with an instant coldness, as if he did not like her
      asking, and were hesitating whether to answer. But he said at last, &ldquo;She
      is no better. She will be worse before she is better. You see,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;that I haven't been able to arrest the disorder in its first stage. We
      must hope for what can be done now, in the second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had gathered from the half jocose ease with which he had listened to
      Mrs. Maynard's account of herself, and to her own report, an encouragement
      which now fell to the ground &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she assented, in her despair, &ldquo;that is
      the only hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat beside the table in the hotel parlor, where they found themselves
      alone for the moment, and drubbed upon it with an absent look. &ldquo;Have you
      sent for her husband?&rdquo; he inquired, returning to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Mr. Libby telegraphed the evening we saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good,&rdquo; said Dr. Mulbridge, with comfortable approval; and he rose
      to go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace impulsively detained him. &ldquo;I&mdash;won't&mdash;ask you whether you
      consider Mrs. Maynard's case a serious one, if you object to my doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that I object,&rdquo; he said slowly, with a teasing smile, such
      as one might use with a persistent child whom one chose to baffle in that
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She disdained to avail herself of the implied permission. &ldquo;What I mean&mdash;what
      I wish to tell you is&mdash;that I feel myself responsible for her
      sickness, and that if she dies, I shall be guilty of her death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; said Dr. Mulbridge, with more interest, but the same smile. &ldquo;What do
      you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't wish to go that day when she was caught in the storm. But I
      insisted; I forced her to go.&rdquo; She stood panting with the intensity of the
      feeling which had impelled her utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by forcing her to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I&mdash;I&mdash;persuaded her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mulbridge smiled, as if he perceived her intention not to tell him
      something she wished to tell him. He looked down into his hat, which he
      carried in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you believe the storm was coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you did n't make it come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you don't at all understand!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a doctor of divinity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, wait!&rdquo; she implored, &ldquo;I'm afraid&mdash;I don't know&mdash;Perhaps
      my being near her is injurious to her; perhaps I ought to let some one
      else nurse her. I wished to ask you this&rdquo;&mdash;She stopped breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you have done her any harm as yet,&rdquo; he answered lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; he said, after a moment's consideration, &ldquo;why don't you take a
      holiday? Some of the other ladies might look after her a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think,&rdquo; she palpitated, &ldquo;that I might? Do you think I
      ought? I'm afraid I ought n't&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if your devotion is hurtful to her?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Send some one else to
      her for a while. Any one can take care of her for a few hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't leave her&mdash;feeling as I do about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how you feel about her,&rdquo; said Dr. Mulbridge. &ldquo;But you can't
      go on at this rate. I shall want your help by and by, and Mrs. Maynard
      doesn't need you now. Don't go back to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she should get worse while I am away&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think your staying and feeling bad would make her better? Don't go
      back,&rdquo; he repeated; and he went out to his ugly rawboned horse, and,
      mounting his shabby wagon, rattled away. She lingered, indescribably put
      to shame by the brutal common sense which she could not impeach, but which
      she still felt was no measure of the case. It was true that she had not
      told him everything, and she could not complain that he had mocked her
      appeal for sympathy if she had trifled with him by a partial confession.
      But she indignantly denied to herself that she had wished to appeal to him
      for sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wandered out on the piazza, which she found empty, and stood gazing at
      the sea in a revery of passionate humiliation. She was in that mood,
      familiar to us all, when we long to be consoled and even flattered for
      having been silly. In a woman this mood is near to tears; at a touch of
      kindness the tears come, and momentous questions are decided. What was
      perhaps uppermost in the girl's heart was a detestation of the man to whom
      she had seemed a simpleton; her thoughts pursued him, and divined the
      contempt with which he must be thinking of her and her pretensions. She
      heard steps on the sand, and Libby came round the corner of the house from
      the stable.

    <h2>
      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Libby's friends had broken up their camp on the beach, and had gone to a
      lake in the heart of the woods for the fishing. He had taken a room at the
      Long Beach House, but he spent most of his time at Jocelyn's, where he
      kept his mare for use in going upon errands for Mrs. Maynard. Grace saw
      him constantly, and he was always doing little things for her with a
      divination of her unexpressed desires which women find too rarely in men.
      He brought her flowers, which, after refusing them for Mrs. Maynard the
      first time, she accepted for herself. He sometimes brought her books, the
      light sort which form the sentimental currency of young people, and she
      lent them round among the other ladies, who were insatiable of them. She
      took a pleasure in these attentions, as if they had been for some one
      else. In this alien sense she liked to be followed up with a chair to the
      point where she wished to sit; to have her hat fetched, or her shawl; to
      drop her work or her handkerchief, secure that it would be picked up for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all interested her, and it was a relief from the circumstances that
      would have forbidden her to recognize it as gallantry, even if her own
      mind had not been so far from all thought of that. His kindness followed
      often upon some application of hers for his advice or help, for she had
      fallen into the habit of going to him with difficulties. He had a prompt
      common sense that made him very useful in emergencies, and a sympathy or
      an insight that was quick in suggestions and expedients. Perhaps she
      overrated other qualities of his in her admiration of the practical
      readiness which kept his amiability from seeming weak. But the practical
      had so often been the unattainable with her that it was not strange she
      should overrate it, and that she should rest upon it in him with a trust
      that included all he chose to do in her behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, Mr. Libby?&rdquo; she asked, as he came toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anything the matter?&rdquo; he demanded in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you are looking downcast,&rdquo; she cried reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know that I mustn't look downcast. I did n't suppose it would be
      very polite, under the circumstances, to go round looking as bobbish as I
      feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the best thing you could possibly do. But you're not feeling very
      bobbish now.&rdquo; A woman respects the word a man uses, not because she would
      have chosen it, but because she thinks that he has an exact intention in
      it, which could not be reconveyed in a more feminine phrase. In this way
      slang arises. &ldquo;Is n't it time for Mr. Maynard to be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered. Then, &ldquo;How did you know I was thinking of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't. I only happened to think it was time. What are you keeping
      back, Mr. Libby?&rdquo; she pursued tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, upon my honor. I almost wish there were something to keep back.
      But there is n't anything. There have n't been any accidents reported. And
      I should n't keep anything back from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you would be equal to it, whatever it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why you say that.&rdquo; She weakly found comfort in the praise
      which she might once have resented as patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why I should n't,&rdquo; he retorted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am not fit to be trusted at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I haven't the strength, to mean anything,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I thank
      you, thank you very much,&rdquo; she added. She turned her head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound Maynard!&rdquo; cried the young man. &ldquo;I don't see why he does n't
      come. He must have started four days ago. He ought to have' had sense
      enough to telegraph when he did start. I did n't tell his partner to ask
      him. You can't think of everything. I've been trying to find out
      something. I'm going over to Leyden, now, to try to wake up somebody in
      Cheyenne who knows Maynard.&rdquo; He looked ruefully at Grace, who listened
      with anxious unintelligence. &ldquo;You're getting worn out, Miss Breen,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I wish I could ask you to go with me to Leyden. It would do you
      good. But my mare's fallen lame; I've just been to see her. Is there
      anything I can do for you over there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how are you going?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my boat,&rdquo; he answered consciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I've had her put to rights. She was n't much damaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent a moment, while he stood looking down at her in the chair
      into which she had sunk. &ldquo;Does it take you long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. It's shorter than it is by land. I shall have the tide with me
      both ways. I can make the run there and back in a couple of hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden impulse, unreasoned and unreasonable, in which there seemed hope
      of some such atonement, or expiation, as the same ascetic nature would
      once have found in fasting or the scourge, prevailed with her. She rose.
      &ldquo;Mr. Libby,&rdquo; she panted, &ldquo;if you will let me, I should like to go with you
      in your boat. Do you think it will be rough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's a light breeze; just right. You need n't be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not afraid. I should not care if it were rough! I should not care if
      it stormed! I hope it&mdash;I will ask mother to stay with Mrs. Maynard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Breen had not been pleased to have her daughter in charge of Mrs.
      Maynard's case, but she had not liked her giving it up. She had said more
      than once that she had no faith in Dr. Mulbridge. She willingly consented
      to Grace's prayer, and went down into Mrs. Maynard's room, and insinuated
      misgivings in which the sick woman found so much reason that they began
      for the first time to recognize each other's good qualities. They decided
      that the treatment was not sufficiently active, and that she should either
      have something that would be more loosening to the cough, or some
      application&mdash;like mustard plasters&mdash;to her feet, so as to take
      away that stuffed feeling about the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that hour of the afternoon, when most of the ladies were lying down in
      their rooms, Grace met no one on the beach but Miss Gleason and Mrs.
      Alger, who rose from their beds of sand under the cliff at her passage
      with Mr. Libby to his dory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you want to go to Leyden?&rdquo; he asked jocosely over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say you're going?&rdquo; Miss Gleason demanded of Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are brave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shut her novel upon her thumb, that she might have nothing to do but
      admire Grace's courage, as the girl walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will do her good, poor thing,&rdquo; said the elder woman. &ldquo;She looks
      wretchedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand just why she does it,&rdquo; murmured Miss Gleason in adoring
      rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she does it for pleasure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Alger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is n't that,&rdquo; returned Miss Gleason mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, Mr. Libby seemed pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she would never marry HIM!&rdquo; said Miss Gleason.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed, and at that moment Grace also laughed. The strong
      current of her purpose, the sense of escape from the bitter servitude of
      the past week, and the wild hope of final expiation through the chances
      she was tempting gave her a buoyancy long unfelt. She laughed in gayety of
      heart as she helped the young man draw his dory down the sand, and then
      took her place at one end while he gave it the last push and then leaped
      in at the other. He pulled out to where the boat lay tilting at anchor,
      and held the dory alongside by the gunwale that she might step aboard. But
      after rising she faltered, looking intently at the boat as if she missed
      something there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had a man to sail your boat&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had. But I let him go last week. Perhaps I ought to have told you,&rdquo; he
      said, looking up at her aslant. &ldquo;Are you afraid to trust my seamanship?
      Adams was a mere form. He behaved like a fool that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not afraid,&rdquo; said Grace. She stepped from the dory into the boat,
      and he flung out the dory's anchor and followed. The sail went up with a
      pleasant clucking of the tackle, and the light wind filled it. Libby made
      the sheet fast, and, sitting down in the stern on the other side, took the
      tiller and headed the boat toward the town that shimmered in the distance.
      The water hissed at the bow, and seethed and sparkled from the stern; the
      land breeze that bent their sail blew cool upon her cheek and freshened it
      with a tinge of color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will do you good,&rdquo; he said, looking into hers with his kind, gay
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color in her cheeks deepened a little. &ldquo;Oh, I am better than I look. I
      did n't come for&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For medicinal purposes. Well, I am glad of it. We've a good hour between
      us and news or no news from Maynard, and I should like to think we were
      out for pleasure. You don't object?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You can even smoke, if that will heighten the illusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will make it reality. But you don't mean it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. But I could n't have dreamt of smoking in your presence.
      And we take the liberty to dream very strange things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it's shocking what things we do dream of people. But am
      I so forbidding?&rdquo; she asked, a little sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said Libby. He got out a pouch of tobacco and some cigarette
      papers, and putting the tiller under his arm, he made himself a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem interested,&rdquo; he said, as he lifted his eyes from his work, on
      which he found her intent, and struck his fusee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was admiring your skill,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it was worth a voyage to South America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't have thought the voyage was necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, perhaps you think you can do it,&rdquo; he said, handing her the tobacco
      and papers. She took them and made a cigarette. &ldquo;It took me a whole day to
      learn to make bad ones, and this, is beautiful. But I will never smoke it.
      I will keep this always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better smoke it, if you want more,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you make some more? I can't smoke the first one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then smoke the last,&rdquo; she said, offering him the things back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, go on. I'll smoke it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lent herself to the idle humor of the time, and went on making
      cigarettes till there were no more papers. From time to time she looked up
      from this labor, and scanned the beautiful bay, which they had almost
      wholly to themselves. They passed a collier lagging in the deep channel,
      and signalling for a pilot to take her up to the town. A yacht, trim and
      swift, cut across their course; the ladies on board waved a salutation
      with their handkerchiefs, and Libby responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know them?&rdquo; asked Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;But ladies like to take these liberties at a safe
      distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's a specimen of woman's daring,&rdquo; she said, with a self-scornful
      curl of the lip, which presently softened into a wistful smile. &ldquo;How
      lovely it all is!&rdquo; she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there's nothing better in all the world than a sail. It is all the
      world while it lasts. A boat's like your own fireside for snugness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dreamier light came into her eye, which wandered, with a turn of the
      head giving him the tender curve of her cheek, over the levels of the bay,
      roughened everywhere by the breeze, but yellowish green in the channels
      and dark with the thick growth of eel-grass in the shallows; then she
      lifted her face to the pale blue heavens in an effort that slanted towards
      him the soft round of her chin, and showed her full throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the kind of afternoon,&rdquo; she said, still looking at the sky, &ldquo;that
      you think will never end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it would n't,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lowered her eyes to his, and asked: &ldquo;Do you have times when you are
      sorry that you ever tried to do anything&mdash;when it seems foolish to
      have tried?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the other kind of times,&mdash;when I wish that I had tried to do
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I have those, too. It's wholesome to be ashamed of not having
      tried to do anything; but to be ashamed of having tried&mdash;it's like
      death. There seems no recovery from that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not take advantage of her confession, or try to tempt her to
      further confidence; and women like men who have this wisdom, or this
      instinctive generosity, and trust them further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the worst of it is that you can't go back and be like those that have
      never tried at all. If you could, that would be some consolation for
      having failed. There is nothing left of you but your mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;some people are not even mistakes. I suppose that almost
      any sort of success looks a good deal like failure from the inside. It
      must be a poor creature that comes up to his own mark. The best way is not
      to have any mark, and then you're in no danger of not coming up to it.&rdquo; He
      laughed, but she smiled sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't believe in thinking about yourself,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I try a little introspection, now and then. But I soon get through:
      there isn't much of me to think about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don't talk in that way,&rdquo; she pleaded, and she was very charming in
      her earnestness: it was there that her charm lay. &ldquo;I want you to be
      serious with me, and tell me&mdash;tell me how men feel when.&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden splashing startled her, and looking round she saw a multitude of
      curious, great-eyed, black heads, something like the heads of boys, and
      something like the heads of dogs, thrusting from the water, and flashing
      under it again at sight of them with a swish that sent the spray into the
      air. She sprang to her feet. &ldquo;Oh, look at those things! Look at them! Look
      at them!&rdquo; She laid vehement hands upon the young man, and pushed him in
      the direction in which she wished him to look, at some risk of pushing him
      overboard, while he laughed at her ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're seals. The bay's full of them. Did you never see them on the reef
      at Jocelyn's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw them before!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How wonderful they are! Oh!&rdquo; she
      shouted; as one of them glanced sadly at her over its shoulder, and then
      vanished with a whirl of the head. &ldquo;The Beatrice Cenci attitude!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They 're always trying that,&rdquo; said Libby. &ldquo;Look yonder.&rdquo; He pointed to a
      bank of mud which the tide had not yet covered, and where a herd of seals
      lay basking in the sun. They started at his voice, and wriggling and
      twisting and bumping themselves over the earth to the water's edge, they
      plunged in. &ldquo;Their walk isn't so graceful as their swim. Would you like
      one for a pet, Miss Breen? That's all they 're good for since kerosene
      came in. They can't compete with that, and they're not the kind that wear
      the cloaks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was standing with her hand pressed hard upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they ever kill them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They used to take that precaution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With those eyes? It was murder!&rdquo; She withdrew her hand and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they only catch them, now. I tried it myself once. I set out at low
      tide, about ten o'clock, one night, and got between the water and the
      biggest seal on the bank. We fought it out on that line till daylight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you get it?&rdquo; she demanded, absurdly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it got me. The tide came in, and the seal beat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you want with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I wanted it at all. At any rate, that's what I always said.
      I shall have to ask you to sit on this side,&rdquo; he added, loosening the
      sheet and preparing to shift the sail. &ldquo;The wind has backed round a little
      more to the south, and it's getting lighter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's going down we shall be late,&rdquo; she said, with an intimation of
      apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be at Leyden on time. If the wind falls then, I can get a horse
      at the stable and have you driven back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kept scanning the sky. Then, &ldquo;Did you ever hear them whistle for a
      wind?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What is it like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Adams does it, it's like this.&rdquo; He put on a furtive look, and
      glanced once or twice at her askance. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said with the
      reproduction of a strong nasal, &ldquo;of course I don't believe there's
      anything in it. Of course it's all foolishness. Now you must urge me a
      little,&rdquo; he added, in his own manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by all means go on, Mr. Adams,&rdquo; she cried, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rolled his head again to one side sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't presume it DOES have anything to do with the wind&mdash;well,
      I don't PRESUME it does.&rdquo; He was silent long enough to whet an imagined
      expectation; then he set his face towards the sky, and began a soft, low,
      coaxing sibilation between his teeth. &ldquo;S-s-s-s; s-s-s-s-s-s! Well, it
      don't stand to reason it can bring the wind&mdash;S-s-s-s-s-s-s; s-s-s-s.
      Why, of course it 's all foolishness. S-s-s-s.&rdquo; He continued to emit these
      sibilants, interspersing them with Adams's protests. Suddenly the sail
      pulled the loose sheet taut and the boat leaped forward over the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; cried the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I said to Adams, or words to that effect. But I thought we
      should get it from the look of the sky before I proposed to whistle for
      it. Now, then,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I will be serious, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Didn't you ask me to be serious just before those seals interrupted
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, coloring a little. &ldquo;I don't think we can go back to
      that, now.&rdquo; He did not insist, and she said presently, &ldquo;I thought the
      sailors had a superstition about ships that are lucky and unlucky. But
      you've kept your boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kept her for luck: the lightning never strikes twice in the same place.
      And I never saw a boat that behaved so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call it behaving well to tip over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She behaved well before that. She didn't tip over outside the reef&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly goes very smoothly,&rdquo; said the girl. She had in vain recurred
      to the tragic motive of her coming; she could not revive it; there had
      been nothing like expiation in this eventless voyage; it had been a
      pleasure and no penance. She abandoned herself with a weak luxury to the
      respite from suffering and anxiety; she made herself the good comrade of
      the young man whom perhaps she even tempted to flatter her farther and
      farther out of the dreariness in which she had dwelt; and if any woful
      current of feeling swept beneath, she would not fathom it, but resolutely
      floated, as one may at such times, on the surface. They laughed together
      and jested; they talked in the gay idleness of such rare moods.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed a yacht at anchor, and a young fellow in a white duck cap,
      leaning over the rail, saluted Libby with the significant gravity which
      one young man uses towards another whom he sees in a sail-boat with a
      pretty girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed at this. &ldquo;Do you know your friend?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. This time I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He fancies you are taking some young lady a sail. What would he say if
      you were to stop and introduce me to him as Dr. Breen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he knows who you are. It's Johnson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one whose clothes you came over in, that morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I suppose you laughed at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked your having the courage to do it. But how does he know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I described you. He's rather an old friend.&rdquo; This also amused
      her. &ldquo;I should like to hear how you described me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you sometime. It was an elaborate description. I could n't
      get through with it now before we landed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old town had come out of the haze of the distance,&mdash;a straggling
      village of weather-beaten wood and weather-beaten white paint,
      picturesque, but no longer a vision of gray stone and pale marble. A
      coal-yard, and a brick locomotive house, and rambling railroad sheds
      stretched along the water-front. They found their way easily enough
      through the sparse shipping to the steps at the end of the wooden pier,
      where Libby dropped the sail and made his boat fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little pleasant giddiness, as if the lightness of her heart had mounted
      to her head, made her glad of his arm up these steps and up the wharf; and
      she kept it as they climbed the sloping elm-shaded village street to the
      main thoroughfare, with its brick sidewalks, its shops and awnings, and
      its cheerful stir and traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telegraph office fronted the head of the street which they had
      ascended. &ldquo;You can sit here in the apothecary's till I come down,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that will be professionally appropriate? I am only a nurse
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wasn't thinking of that. But I saw a chair in there. And we can
      make a pretense of wanting some soda. It is the proper thing to treat
      young ladies to soda when one brings them in from the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does have that appearance,&rdquo; she assented, with a smile. She kept him
      waiting with what would have looked like coquettish hesitation in another,
      while she glanced at the windows overhead, pierced by a skein of
      converging wires. &ldquo;Suppose I go up with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like that better,&rdquo; he said; and she followed him lightly up the
      stairs that led to the telegraph office. A young man stood at the machine
      with a cigar in his mouth, and his eyes intent upon the ribbon of paper
      unreeling itself before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just hold on,&rdquo; he said to Libby, without turning his head. &ldquo;I've got
      something here for you.&rdquo; He read: &ldquo;Despatch received yesterday. Coming
      right through. George Maynard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Libby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dated Council Bluffs. Want it written out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What 's to pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paid,&rdquo; said the operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laconically transacted business ended with this, the wire began to
      cluck again like the anxious hen whose manner the most awful and
      mysterious of the elements assumes in becoming articulate, and nothing
      remained for them but to come away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was what I was afraid of,&rdquo; said Libby. &ldquo;Maynard was at his ranch,
      and it must have been a good way out. They're fifty or sixty miles out,
      sometimes. That would account for the delay. Well, Mrs. Maynard doesn't
      know how long it takes to come from Cheyenne, and we can tell her he's on
      the way, and has telegraphed.&rdquo; They were walking rapidly down the street
      to the wharf where his boat lay. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed, halting abruptly. &ldquo;I
      promised to send you back by land, if you preferred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the wind fallen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. We shall have a good breeze:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't put you to the trouble of getting a horse. I can go back
      perfectly well in the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's what I think,&rdquo; he said cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not respond, and he could not be aware that any change had come
      over her mood. But when they were once more seated in the boat, and the
      sail was pulling in the fresh breeze, she turned to him with a scarcely
      concealed indignation. &ldquo;Have you a fancy for experimenting upon people,
      Mr. Libby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Experimenting? I? I don't know in the least what you mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you tell me that the operator was a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the other operator is,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, and fell blankly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a good deal of business there. They have to have two operators,&rdquo;
       he explained, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; she murmured in deep humiliation. If he had suffered her
      to be silent as long as she would, she might have offered him some
      reparation; but he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you think I had been experimenting on you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she repeated. The sense of having put herself in the wrong
      exasperated her with him. &ldquo;Oh, I dare say you were curious. Don't you
      suppose I have noticed that men are puzzled at me? What did you mean by
      saying that you thought I would be equal to anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant&mdash;I thought you would like to be treated frankly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would n't treat everybody so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't treat Mrs. Maynard so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You treat me upon a theory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you like that? We treat everybody upon a theory&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I should tell you the worst of anything at once, because I think you
      are one of the kind that don't like to have their conclusions made for
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would really let women make their own conclusions,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;You are very peculiar!&rdquo; She waited a while, and then she asked, &ldquo;And what
      is your theory of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you are very peculiar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is pride so very peculiar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; in women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! You set up for a connoisseur of female character. That's very
      common, nowadays. Why don't you tell me something more about Yourself?
      We're always talking about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He might well have been doubtful of her humor. He seemed to decide that
      she was jesting, for he answered lightly, &ldquo;Why, you began it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I did, this time. But now I wish to stop it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at the tiller in his hands. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should like
      to tell you about myself. I should like to know what you think of the kind
      of man I am. Will you be honest if I will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a very strange condition,&rdquo; she answered, meeting and then avoiding
      the gaze he lifted to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Being honest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no&mdash;Or, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is n't for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. But I'm not under discussion now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in the first place,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I was afraid of you when we met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is n't the word, perhaps. We'll say ashamed of myself. Mrs. Maynard
      told me about you, and I thought you would despise me for not doing or
      being anything in particular. I thought you must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, as if still uncertain of her mood from this intonation, and
      then he went on: &ldquo;But I had some little hope you would tolerate me, after
      all. You looked like a friend I used to have.&mdash;Do you mind my telling
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. Though I can't say that it's ever very comfortable to be told
      that you look like some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose any one else would have been struck by the resemblance,&rdquo;
       said Libby, with a laugh of reminiscence. &ldquo;He was huge. But he had eyes
      like a girl,&mdash;I beg your pardon,&mdash;like yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that I have eyes like a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, and said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and then turned grave. &ldquo;As long as he lived&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is he dead?&rdquo; she asked more gently than she had yet spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he died just before I went abroad. I went out on business for my
      father,&mdash;he's an importer and jobber,&mdash;and bought goods for him.
      Do you despise business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did it to please my father, and he said I was a very good buyer. He
      thinks there's nothing like buying&mdash;except selling. He used to sell
      things himself, over the counter, and not so long ago, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancied it made a difference for me when I was in college, and that the
      yardstick came between me and society. I was an ass for thinking anything
      about it. Though I did n't really care, much. I never liked society, and I
      did like boats and horses. I thought of a profession, once. But it would
      n't work. I've been round the world twice, and I've done nothing but enjoy
      myself since I left college,&mdash;or try to. When I first saw you I was
      hesitating about letting my father make me of use. He wants me to become
      one of the most respectable members of society, he wants me to be a
      cotton-spinner. You know there 's nothing so irreproachable as cotton, for
      a business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I don't know about those things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there is n't. When I was abroad, buying and selling, I made a
      little discovery: I found that there were goods we could make and sell in
      the European market cheaper than the English, and that gave my father the
      notion of buying a mill to make them. I'm boring you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he bought it; and he wants me to take charge of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shall you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I'm fit for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? How should I know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know cotton; but you know me a little. Do I strike you as fit
      for anything?&rdquo; She made no reply to this, and he laughed. &ldquo;I assure you I
      felt small enough when I heard what you had done, and thought&mdash;what I
      had done. It gave me a start; and I wrote my father that night that I
      would go in for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I once thought of going to a factory town,&rdquo; she answered, without wilful
      evasion, &ldquo;to begin my practice there among the operatives' children. I
      should have done it if it had not been for coming here with Mrs. Maynard.
      It would have been better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to my factory town, Miss Breen! There ought to be fevers there in
      the autumn, with all the low lands that I'm allowed to flood Mrs. Maynard
      told me about your plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, what else did Mrs. Maynard tell you about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About your taking up a profession, in the way you did, when you needn't,
      and when you did n't particularly like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said. Then she added, &ldquo;And because I was n't obliged to it, and
      did n't like it, you tolerated me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tolerated?&rdquo; he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This vexed her. &ldquo;Yes, tolerate! Everybody, interested or not, has to make
      up his mind whether to tolerate me as soon as he hears what I am. What
      excuse did you make for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't make any,&rdquo; said Libby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had your misgiving, your surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought if you could stand it, other people might. I thought it was
      your affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as if I had been a young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! That wasn't possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent. Then, &ldquo;The conversation has got back into the old
      quarter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are talking about me again. Have you heard from
      your friends since they went away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those you were camping with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did they say when they heard that you had found a young doctress at
      Jocelyn's? How did you break the fact to them? What jokes did they make?
      You need n't be afraid to tell me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Give me Mr. Johnson's
      comments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her in surprise that incensed her still more, and rendered
      her incapable of regarding the pain with which he answered her. &ldquo;I 'm
      afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I have done something to offend you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! What could you have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you really mean to ask me whether I would let any one make a joke of
      you in my presence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it was impossible,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why was it impossible?&rdquo; she pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been looking him defiantly in the eyes, and she could not withdraw
      her gaze. For the endless moment that ensued, her breath was taken away.
      Then she asked in a low, steady voice, &ldquo;Did you mean to say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you, and I forgive you. No, no!&rdquo; she cried, at a demonstration
      of protest from him, &ldquo;don't speak again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed, instantly, implicitly. With the tiller in his hand he looked
      past her and guided the boat's course. It became intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I ever done anything that gave you the right to&mdash;to&mdash;say
      that?&rdquo; she asked, without the self-command which she might have wished to
      show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you were only the most beautiful&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not beautiful! And if I were&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't to be helped! I saw from the first how good and noble you were,
      and&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is absurd!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I am neither good nor noble; and if I
      were&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't make any difference. Whatever you are, you are the one woman
      in the world to me; and you always will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Libby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I must speak now! You were always thinking, because you had studied a
      man's profession, that no one would think of you as a woman, as if that
      could make any difference to a man that had the soul of a man in him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I did n't think that. I always expected to be
      considered as a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not as a woman to fall in love with. I understood. And that somehow
      made you all the dearer to me. If you had been a girl like other girls, I
      should n't have cared for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't mean to speak to you to-day. But sometime I did mean to speak;
      because, whatever I was, I loved you; and I thought you did n't dislike
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did like you,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;very much. And I respected you. But you
      can't say that I ever gave you any hope in this&mdash;this&mdash;way.&rdquo; She
      almost asked him if she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&mdash;not purposely. And if you did, it 's over now. You have
      rejected me. I understand that. There's no reason why you shouldn't. And I
      can hold my tongue.&rdquo; He did not turn, but looked steadily past her at the
      boat's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      An emotion stirred in her breast which took the form of a reproach. &ldquo;Was
      it fair, then, to say this when neither of us could escape afterwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't mean to speak,&rdquo; he said, without looking up, &ldquo;and I never meant
      to place you where you could n't escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true that she had proposed to go with him in the boat, and that she
      had chosen to come back with him, when he had offered to have her driven
      home from Leyden. &ldquo;No, you are not to blame,&rdquo; she said, at last. &ldquo;I asked
      to some with you. Shall I tell you why?&rdquo; Her voice began to break. In her
      pity for him and her shame for herself the tears started to her eyes. She
      did not press her question, but, &ldquo;Thank you for reminding me that I
      invited myself to go with you,&rdquo; she said, with feeble bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her in silent wonder, and she broke into a sob. He said
      gently, &ldquo;I don't suppose you expect me to deny that. You don't think me
      such a poor dog as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course not,&rdquo; she answered, with quivering lips, while she pressed
      her handkerchief to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only too glad to have you come. I always meant to tell you&mdash;what
      I have told; but not when I should seem to trap you into listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I can believe that of you. I do believe it. I take
      back what I said. Don't let us speak of it any more now,&rdquo; she continued,
      struggling for her lost composure, with what success appeared in the fresh
      outburst with which she recognized his forbearance to hint at any
      painfulness to himself in the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind it so much on my account, but oh! how could you for your own
      sake? Do let us get home as fast as we can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am doing everything I can to release you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you will sit
      here,&rdquo; he added, indicating the place beside him in the stern, &ldquo;you won't
      have to change so much when I want to tack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the other seat, and for the first time she noticed that the wind
      had grown very light. She watched him with a piteous impatience while he
      shifted the sail from side to side, keeping the sheet in his hand for
      convenience in the frequent changes. He scanned the sky, and turned every
      current of the ebbing tide to account. It was useless; the boat crept, and
      presently it scarcely moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind is down,&rdquo; he said, making the sheet fast, and relaxing his hold
      on the tiller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;And the tide is going out!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tide is going out,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we should get caught on these flats,&rdquo; she began, with rising
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should have to stay till the tide turned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked wildly about for aid. If there were a row-boat anywhere within
      hail, she could be taken to Jocelyn's in that. But they were quite alone
      on those lifeless waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Libby got out a pair of heavy oars from the bottom of the boat, and,
      setting the rowlocks on either side, tugged silently at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The futile effort suggested an idea to her which doubtless she would not
      have expressed if she had not been lacking, as she once said, in a sense
      of humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you whistle for a wind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her in sad astonishment to make sure that she was in earnest,
      and then, &ldquo;Whistle!&rdquo; he echoed forlornly, and broke into a joyless laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew the chances of delay that I took in asking to come with you,&rdquo;
       she cried, &ldquo;and you should have warned me. It was ungenerous&mdash;it was
      ungentlemanly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was whatever you like. I must be to blame. I suppose I was too glad to
      have you come. If I thought anything, I thought you must have some
      particular errand at Leyden. You seemed anxious to go, even if it
      stormed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it had stormed,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;I should not have cared! I hoped it
      would storm. Then at least I should have run the same danger,&mdash;I
      hoped it would be dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand what you mean,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forced that wretched creature to go with you that day when you said it
      was going to be rough; and I shall have her blood upon my hands if she
      dies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; cried Libby, pulling in his useless oars, and leaning
      forward upon them, &ldquo;that she has gone on letting you think I believed
      there was going to be a storm? She knew perfectly well that I didn't mind
      what Adams said; he was always croaking.&rdquo; She sat looking at him in a
      daze, but she could not speak, and he continued. &ldquo;I see: it happened by
      one chance in a million to turn out as he said; and she has been making
      you pay for it. Why, I suppose,&rdquo; he added, with a melancholy smile of
      intelligence, &ldquo;she's had so much satisfaction in holding you responsible
      for what's happened, that she's almost glad of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has tortured me!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;But you&mdash;you, when you saw
      that I did n't believe there was going to be any storm, why did you&mdash;why
      didn't&mdash;you&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't believe it either! It was Mrs. Maynard that proposed the sail,
      but when I saw that you did n't like it I was glad of any excuse for
      putting it off. I could n't help wanting to please you, and I couldn't see
      why you urged us afterwards; but I supposed you had some reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed her hand over her forehead, as if to clear away the confusion
      in which all this involved her. &ldquo;But why&mdash;why did you let me go on
      thinking myself to blame&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I know what you were thinking? Heaven knows I didn't dream of
      such a thing! Though I remember, now, your saying&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You are a man! But I can't forgive it,&mdash;no,
      I can't forgive it! You wished to deceive her if you did n't wish to
      deceive me. How can you excuse yourself for repeating what you did n't
      believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was willing she should think Adams was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was deceit. What can you say to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one thing I could say,&rdquo; he murmured, looking hopelessly
      into her eyes, &ldquo;and that's of no use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head away. Her tragedy had fallen to nothing; or rather it
      had never been. All her remorse, all her suffering, was mere farce now;
      but his guilt in the matter was the greater. A fierce resentment burned in
      her heart; she longed to make him feel something of the anguish she had
      needlessly undergone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat watching her averted face. &ldquo;Miss Breen,&rdquo; he said huskily, &ldquo;will you
      let me speak to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you have me in your power,&rdquo; she answered cruelly. &ldquo;Say what you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak, nor make any motion to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      A foolish, idle curiosity to know what, after all that had happened, he
      could possibly have to say, stirred within her, but she disdainfully
      stifled it. They were both so still that a company of seals found it safe
      to put their heads above water, and approach near enough to examine her
      with their round soft eyes. She turned from the silly things in contempt
      that they should even have interested her. She felt that from time to time
      her companion lifted an anxious glance to the dull heavens. At last the
      limp sail faintly stirred; it flapped; it filled shallowly; the boat
      moved. The sail seemed to have had a prescience of the wind before it
      passed over the smooth water like a shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a woman says she never will forgive a man, she always has a condition
      of forgiveness in her heart. Now that the wind had risen again, &ldquo;I have no
      right to forbid you to speak,&rdquo; she said, as if no silence had elapsed, and
      she turned round and quietly confronted him; she no longer felt so
      impatient to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not meet her eye at once, and he seemed in no haste to avail
      himself of the leave granted him. A heavy sadness blotted the gayety of a
      face whose sunny sympathy had been her only cheer for many days. She
      fancied a bewilderment in its hopelessness which smote her with still
      sharper pathos. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I appreciate your wish to do what
      I wanted, about Mrs. Maynard. I remember my telling you that she ought n't
      to go out, that day. But that was not the way to do it&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no other,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she assented, upon reflection. &ldquo;Then it ought n't to have been
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He showed no sign of intending to continue, and after a moment of
      restlessness, she began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have been rude or hasty in refusing to hear you, Mr. Libby, I am
      very wrong. I must hear anything you have to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not unless you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish whatever you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sure that I wish that now. I have thought it over; I should only
      distress you for nothing. You are letting me say why sentence shouldn't be
      passed upon me. Sentence is going to be passed any way. I should only
      repeat what I have said. You would pity me, but you couldn't help me. And
      that would give you pain for nothing. No, it would be useless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be useless to talk to me about&mdash;loving.&rdquo; She took the word
      on her lips with a certain effect of adopting it for convenience' sake in
      her vocabulary. &ldquo;All that was ended for me long ago,&mdash;ten years ago.
      And my whole life since then has been shaped to do without it. I will tell
      you my story if you like. Perhaps it's your due. I wish to be just. You
      may have a right to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't. But&mdash;perhaps I ought to say that Mrs. Maynard told me
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am glad of that, though she had no right to do it. Then you can
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I can understand. I don't pretend that I had any reason in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He forbore again to urge any plea for himself, and once more she was
      obliged to interfere in his behalf. &ldquo;Mr. Libby, I have never confessed
      that I once wronged you in a way that I'm very sorry for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Mrs. Maynard? Yes, I know. I won't try to whitewash myself; but it
      didn't occur to me how it would look. I wanted to talk with her about
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have considered her, though,&rdquo; she said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ought to have considered herself,&rdquo; he retorted, with his unfailing
      bitterness for Mrs. Maynard. &ldquo;But it doesn't matter whose fault it was.
      I'm sufficiently punished; for I know that it injured me with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did at first. But now I can see that I was wrong. I wished to tell you
      that. It isn't creditable to me that I thought you intended to flirt with
      her. If I had been better myself&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; He could not say more.
    </p>
    <p>
      That utter faith in her was very charming. It softened her more and more;
      it made her wish to reason with him, and try gently to show him how
      impossible his hope was. &ldquo;And you know,&rdquo; she said, recurring to something
      that had gone before, &ldquo;that even if I had cared for you in the way you
      wish, it could n't be. You would n't want to have people laughing and
      saying I had been a doctress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't have minded. I know how much people's talk is worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know you would be generous and brave about that&mdash;about
      anything. But what&mdash;what if I could n't give up my career&mdash;my
      hopes of being useful in the way I have planned? You would n't have liked
      me to go on practising medicine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; he answered simply. &ldquo;I didn't see how it could be
      done. But if you saw any way, I was willing&mdash;No, that was my great
      trouble! I knew that it was selfish in me, and very conceited, to suppose
      you would give up your whole life for me; and whenever I thought of that,
      I determined not to ask you. But I tried not to think of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't you see? But if I could have answered you as you wish, it
      wouldn't have been anything to give up everything for you. A woman isn't
      something else first, and a woman afterwards. I understand how unselfishly
      you meant, and indeed, indeed, I thank you. But don't let's talk of it any
      more. It couldn't have been, and there is nothing but misery in thinking
      of it. Come,&rdquo; she said, with a struggle for cheerfulness, &ldquo;let us forget
      it. Let it be just as if you hadn't spoken to me; I know you did n't
      intend to do it; and let us go on as if nothing had happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we can't go on,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I shall get away, as soon as Maynard
      comes, and rid you of the sight of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going away?&rdquo; she softly asked. &ldquo;Why need you? I know that people
      always seem to think they can't be friends after&mdash;such a thing as
      this. But why shouldn't we? I respect you, and I like you very much. You
      have shown me more regard and more kindness than any other friend&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wasn't your friend,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;I loved you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she sighed, in gentle perplexity, &ldquo;then you can't be my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. But I shall always love you. If it would do any good, I would
      stay, as you ask it. I should n't mind myself. But I should be a nuisance
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I will take the risk of that. I need your
      advice, your&mdash;sympathy, your&mdash;You won't trouble me, indeed you
      won't. Perhaps you have mistaken your&mdash;feeling about me. It's such a
      very little time since we met,&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes no difference,&mdash;the time. And I'm not mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, stay at least till Mrs. Maynard is well, and we can all go away
      together. Promise me that!&rdquo; She instinctively put out her hand toward him
      in entreaty. He took it, and pressing it to his lips covered it with
      kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she grieved in reproachful surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You see that I must go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she sighed in assent, &ldquo;you must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did not look at each other again, but remained in a lamentable
      silence while the boat pushed swiftly before the freshening breeze; and
      when they reached the place where the dory lay, he dropped the sail and
      threw out the anchor without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was haggard to the glance she stole at him, when they had taken their
      places in the dory, and he confronted her, pulling hard at the oars. He
      did not lift his eyes to hers, but from time to time he looked over his
      shoulder at the boat's prow, and he rowed from one point to another for a
      good landing. A dreamy pity for him filled her; through the memories of
      her own suffering, she divined the soreness of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started from her reverie as the bottom of the dory struck the sand.
      The shoal water stretched twenty feet beyond. He pulled in the oars and
      rose desperately. &ldquo;It's of no use: I shall have to carry you ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat staring up into his face, and longing to ask him something, to
      accuse him of having done this purposely. But she had erred in so many
      doubts, her suspicions of him had all recoiled so pitilessly upon her,
      that she had no longer the courage to question or reproach him. &ldquo;Oh, no,
      thank you,&rdquo; she said weakly. &ldquo;I won't trouble you. I&mdash;I will wait
      till the tide is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tide's out now,&rdquo; he answered with coldness, &ldquo;and you can't wade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose desperately. &ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo; she cried in self-contempt,
      glancing at the water, into which he promptly stepped to his boot-tops. &ldquo;A
      woman must n't get her feet wet.&rdquo;

      VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Grace went to her own room to lay aside her shawl and hat, before going to
      Mrs. Maynard, and found her mother sewing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, who is with Mrs. Maynard?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Gleason is reading to her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Breen. &ldquo;If she had any sort of
      active treatment, she could get well at once. I couldn't take the
      responsibility of doing anything for her, and it was such a worry to stay
      and see everything going wrong, that when Miss Gleason came in I was glad
      to get away. Miss Gleason seems to believe in your Dr. Mulbridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dr. Mulbridge!&rdquo; echoed Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She talked of him as if he were yours. I don't know what you've been
      saying to her about him; but you had better be careful. The woman is a
      fool.&rdquo; She now looked up at her daughter for the first time. &ldquo;Why, what is
      the matter with you what kept you so long? You look perfectly wild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel wild,&rdquo; said Grace calmly. &ldquo;The wind went down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that all? I don't see why that should make you feel wild,&rdquo; said her
      mother, dropping her spectacles to her sewing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was n't all,&rdquo; answered the girl, sinking provisionally upon the side
      of a chair, with her shawl still on her arm, and her hat in her hand.
      &ldquo;Mother, have you noticed anything peculiar about Mr. Libby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's the only person who seems to be of the slightest use about here;
      I've noticed that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Breen. &ldquo;He's always going and coming for you
      and Mrs. Maynard. Where is that worthless husband of hers? Has n't he had
      time to come from Cheyenne yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's on the way. He was out at his ranch when Mr. Libby telegraphed
      first, and had to be sent for. We found a despatch from him at Leyden,
      saying he had started,&rdquo; Grace explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business had he to be so far away at all?&rdquo; demanded her mother. It
      was plain that Mrs. Breen was in her most censorious temper, which had
      probably acquired a sharper edge towards Maynard from her reconciliation
      with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace seized her chance to meet the worst. &ldquo;Do you think that I have done
      anything to encourage Mr. Libby?&rdquo; she asked, looking bravely at her
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Encourage him to do what?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Breen, without lifting her eyes
      from her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Encouraged him to&mdash;think I cared for him; to&mdash;to be in love
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Breen lifted her head now, and pushed her spectacles up on her
      forehead, while she regarded her daughter in silence. &ldquo;Has he been making
      love to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother pushed her spectacles down again; and, turning the seam which
      she had been sewing, flattened it with her thumb-nail. She made this
      action expressive of having foreseen such a result, and of having
      struggled against it, neglected and alone. &ldquo;Very well, then. I hope you
      accepted him?&rdquo; she asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? You must like him,&rdquo; she continued in the same tone. &ldquo;You have
      been with him every moment the last week that you have n't been with Mrs.
      Maynard. At least I've seen nothing of you, except when you came to tell
      me you were going to walk or to drive with him. You seem to have asked him
      to take you most of the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say such a thing, mother?&rdquo; cried the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n't you ask him to let you go with him this afternoon? You told me
      you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did. I did it for a purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! for a purpose,&rdquo; said Mrs. Breen, taking a survey of the new seam,
      which she pulled from her knee, where one end of it was pinned, towards
      her chin. She left the word to her daughter, who was obliged to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked him to let me go with him because Louise had tortured me about
      making her go out in his boat, till I could n't bear it any longer. It
      seemed to me that if I took the same risk myself, it would be something;
      and I hoped there would be a storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you had taken leave of your senses,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen observed,
      with her spectacles intent upon her seam. &ldquo;Did you think it would be any
      consolation to him if you were drowned, or to her? And if,&rdquo; she added, her
      conscience rising equal to the vicarious demand upon it, &ldquo;you hoped there
      would be danger, had you any right to expose him to it? Even if you chose
      to risk your own life, you had no right to risk his.&rdquo; She lifted her
      spectacles again, and turned their austere glitter upon her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it all seems very silly now,&rdquo; said the girl, with a hopeless sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; cried her mother. &ldquo;I'm glad you can call it silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it seemed worse still when he told me that he had never believed it
      was going to storm that day, when he took Louise out. His man said it was,
      and he repeated it because he saw I did n't want her to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Breen, &ldquo;if he was willing to deceive her then,
      he is willing to deceive you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't deceive her. He said what he had heard. And he said it because
      he&mdash;I wished it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it deceiving. Truth is truth. That is what I was taught; and
      that's what I supposed I had taught you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would trust Mr. Libby in anything,&rdquo; returned the daughter. &ldquo;He is
      perfectly frank about himself. He confessed that he had done it to please
      me. He said that nothing else could excuse it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then you have accepted him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mother, I haven't. I have refused him, and he is going away as soon
      as Mr. Maynard comes.&rdquo; She sat looking at the window, and the tears stole
      into her eyes, and blurred the sea and sky together where she saw their
      meeting at the horizon line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;their that is the end of it, I presume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's the end,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;But&mdash;I felt sorry for him,
      mother. Once,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I thought I had everything clear before me;
      but now I seem only to have made confusion of my life. Yes,&rdquo; she added
      drearily, &ldquo;it was foolish and wicked, and it was perfectly useless, too. I
      can't escape from the consequences of what I did. It makes no difference
      what he believed or any one believed. I drove them on to risk their lives
      because I thought myself so much better than they; because I was
      self-righteous and suspicious and stubborn. Well, I must bear the penalty:
      and oh, if I could only bear it alone!&rdquo; With a long sigh she took back the
      burden which she had been struggling to cast off, and from which for a
      time she had actually seemed to escape. She put away her hat and shawl,
      and stood before the glass, smoothing her hair. &ldquo;When will it ever end?&rdquo;
       she moaned to the reflection there, rather than to her mother, who did not
      interrupt this spiritual ordeal. In another age, such a New England girl
      would have tortured herself with inquisition as to some neglected duty to
      God;&mdash;in ours, when religion is so largely humanified, this Puritan
      soul could only wreak itself in a sense of irreparable wrong to her
      fellow-creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she went out she met Miss Gleason half-way down the corridor to Mrs.
      Maynard's door. The latter had a book in her hand, and came forward
      whispering. &ldquo;She's asleep,&rdquo; she said very sibilantly. &ldquo;I have read her to
      sleep, and she's sleeping beautifully. Have you ever read it?&rdquo; she asked,
      with hoarse breaks from her undertone, as she held up one of those cheap
      library-editions of a novel toward Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane Eyre? Why, of course. Long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; said Miss Gleason. &ldquo;But I sent and got it again, to refresh
      my impressions of Rochester. We all think Dr. Mulbridge is just like him.
      Rochester is my ideal character,&mdash;a perfect conception of a man: so
      abrupt, so rough, so savage. Oh, I like those men! Don't you?&rdquo; she fluted.
      &ldquo;Mrs. Maynard sees the resemblance, as well as the rest of us. But I know!
      You don't approve of them. I suppose they can't be defended on some
      grounds; but I can see how, even in such a case as this, the perfect
      mastery of the man-physician constitutes the highest usefulness of the
      woman-physician. The advancement of women must be as women. 'Male and
      female created he them,' and it is only in remembering this that we are
      helping Gawd, whether as an anthropomorphic conception or a universally
      pervading instinct of love, don't you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her novel clapped against her breast, she leaned winningly over
      toward Grace, and fixed her with her wide eyes, which had rings of white
      round the pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell me!&rdquo; she ran on without waiting an answer. &ldquo;Didn't you go with
      Mr. Libby because you hoped it might storm, and wished to take the same
      risk as Mrs. Maynard? I told Mrs. Alger you did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace flushed guiltily, and Miss Gleason cowered a little, perhaps
      interpreting the color as resentment. &ldquo;I should consider that a very silly
      motive,&rdquo; she said, helplessly ashamed that she was leaving the weight of
      the blow upon Miss Gleason's shoulders instead of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Miss Gleason enthusiastically, &ldquo;you can't confess it.
      But I know you are capable of such a thing&mdash;of anything heroic! Do
      forgive me,&rdquo; she said, seizing Grace's hand. She held it a moment, gazing
      with a devouring fondness into her face, which she stooped a little
      sidewise to peer up into. Then she quickly dropped her hand, and, whirling
      away, glided slimly out of the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace softly opened Mrs. Maynard's door, and the sick woman opened her
      eyes. &ldquo;I was n't asleep,&rdquo; she said hoarsely, &ldquo;but I had to pretend to be,
      or that woman would have killed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace went to her and felt her hands and her flushed forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am worse this evening,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maynard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; sighed the girl, dropping into a chair at the bedside, with her
      eyes fixed in a sort of fascination on the lurid face of the sick woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After getting me here,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Maynard, in the same low, hoarse
      murmur, &ldquo;you might at least stay with me a little. What kept you so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind fell. We were becalmed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were not becalmed the day I went out with Mr. Libby. But perhaps
      nobody forced you to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having launched this dart, she closed her eyes again with something more
      like content than she had yet shown: it had an aim of which she could
      always be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have heard from Mr. Maynard,&rdquo; said Grace humbly. &ldquo;There was a despatch
      waiting for Mr. Libby at Leyden. He is on his way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maynard betrayed no immediate effect of this other than to say, &ldquo;He
      had better hurry,&rdquo; and did not open her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace went about the room with a leaden weight in every fibre, putting the
      place in order, and Mrs. Maynard did not speak again till she had
      finished. Then she said, &ldquo;I want you to tell me just how bad Dr. Mulbridge
      thinks I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never expressed any anxiety,&rdquo; Grace began, with her inaptness at
      evasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he has n't,&rdquo; murmured the sick woman. &ldquo;He isn't a fool! What
      does he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This passed the sufferance even of remorse. &ldquo;He says you mustn't talk,&rdquo;
       the girl flashed out. &ldquo;And if you insist upon doing so, I will leave you,
      and send some one else to take care of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then. I know what that means. When a doctor tells you not to
      talk, it's because he knows he can't do you any good. As soon as George
      Maynard gets here I will have some one that can cure me, or I will know
      the reason why.&rdquo; The conception of her husband as a champion seemed to
      commend him to her in novel degree. She shed some tears, and after a
      little reflection she asked, &ldquo;How soon will he be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;He seems to have started yesterday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can be here by day after to-morrow,&rdquo; Mrs. Maynard computed. &ldquo;There
      will be some one to look after poor little Bella then,&rdquo; she added, as if,
      during her sickness, Bella must have been wholly neglected. &ldquo;Don't let the
      child be all dirt when her father comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother will look after Bella,&rdquo; Grace replied, too meek again to resent
      the implication. After a pause, &ldquo;Oh, Louise,&rdquo; she added beseechingly,
      &ldquo;I've suffered so much from my own wrong-headedness and obstinacy that I
      couldn't bear to see you taking the same risk, and I'm so glad that you
      are going to meet your husband in the right spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right spirit?&rdquo; croaked Mrs. Maynard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wish to please him, to&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't choose to have him say that his child disgraces him,&rdquo; replied
      Mrs. Maynard, in the low, husky, monotonous murmur in which she was
      obliged to utter everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dear Louise!&rdquo; cried the other, &ldquo;you choose something else too, don't
      you? You wish to meet him as if no unkindness had parted you, and as if
      you were to be always together after this? I hope you do! Then I should
      feel that all this suffering and, trouble was a mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other people's misery is always a mercy to them,&rdquo; hoarsely suggested Mrs.
      Maynard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know that,&rdquo; Grace submitted, with meek conviction. &ldquo;But, Louise,&rdquo;
       she pleaded, &ldquo;you will make up with your husband, won't you? Whatever he
      has done, that will surely be best. I know that you love him, and that he
      must love you, yet. It's the only way. If you were finally separated from
      him, and you and he could be happy apart, what would become of that poor
      child? Who will take a father's place with her? That's the worst about it.
      Oh, Louise, I feel so badly for you&mdash;for what you have lost, and may
      lose. Marriage must change people so that unless they live to each other,
      their lives will be maimed and useless. It ought to be so much easier to
      forgive any wrong your husband does you than to punish it; for that
      perpetuates the wrong, and forgiveness ends it, and it's the only thing
      that can end a wrong. I am sure that your husband will be ready to do or
      say anything you wish; but if he shouldn't, Louise, you will receive him
      forgivingly, and make the first advance? It's a woman's right to make the
      advances in forgiving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maynard lay with her hands stretched at her side under the covering,
      and only her face visible above it. She now turned her head a little, so
      as to pierce the earnest speaker with a gleam from her dull eye. &ldquo;Have you
      accepted Walter Libby?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise!&rdquo; cried Grace, with a blush that burned like fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way I used to talk when I was first engaged. Wait till you're
      married a while. I want Bella to have on her pique, and her pink sash,&mdash;not
      the cherry one. I should think you would have studied to be a minister
      instead of a doctor. But you need n't preach to me; I shall know how to
      behave to George Maynard when he comes,&mdash;if he ever does come. And
      now I should think you had made me talk enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Yes,&rdquo; said Grace, recalled to her more immediate duty in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      All her helpfulness was soon to be needed. The disease, which had lingered
      more than usual in the early stages, suddenly approached a crisis. That
      night Mrs. Maynard grew so much worse that Grace sent Libby at daybreak
      for Dr. Mulbridge; and the young man, after leading out his own mare to
      see if her lameness had abated, ruefully put her back in the stable, and
      set off to Corbitant with the splay-foot at a rate of speed unparalleled,
      probably, in the animal's recollection of a long and useful life. In the
      two anxious days that followed, Libby and Grace were associated in the
      freedom of a common interest outside of themselves; she went to him for
      help and suggestion, and he gave them, as if nothing had passed to
      restrict or embarrass their relations. There was that, in fact, in the awe
      of the time and an involuntary disoccupation of hers that threw them
      together even more constantly than before. Dr. Mulbridge remained with his
      patient well into the forenoon; in the afternoon he came again, and that
      night he did not go away. He superseded Grace as a nurse no less
      completely than he had displaced her as a physician. He let her relieve
      him when he flung himself down for a few minutes' sleep, or when he went
      out for the huge meals which he devoured, preferring the unwholesome
      things with a depravity shocking to the tender physical consciences of the
      ladies who looked on; but when he returned to his charge, he showed
      himself jealous of all that Grace had done involving the exercise of more
      than a servile discretion. When she asked him once if there were nothing
      else that she could do, he said, &ldquo;fires, keep those women and children
      quiet,&rdquo; in a tone that classed her with both. She longed to ask him what
      he thought of Mrs. May nard's condition; but she had not the courage to
      invoke the intelligence that ignored her so completely, and she struggled
      in silence with such disheartening auguries as her theoretical science
      enabled her to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was a Sunday, and the Sabbath hush which always hung over
      Jocelyn's was intensified to the sense of those who ached between hope and
      fear for the life that seemed to waver and flicker in that still air. Dr.
      Mulbridge watched beside his patient, noting every change with a wary
      intelligence which no fact escaped and no anxiety clouded; alert, gentle,
      prompt; suffering no question, and absolutely silent as to all
      impressions. He allowed Grace to remain with him when she liked, and let
      her do his bidding in minor matters; but when from time to time she
      escaped from the intolerable tension in which his reticence and her own
      fear held her, he did not seem to see whether she went or came. Toward
      nightfall she met him coming out of Mrs. Maynard's room, as she drew near
      in the narrow corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your friend&mdash;the young man&mdash;the one who smokes?&rdquo; he
      asked, as if nothing unusual had occupied him. &ldquo;I want him to give me a
      cigar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Mulbridge,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will not bear this any longer. I must know
      the worst&mdash;you have no right to treat me in this way. Tell me now&mdash;tell
      me instantly: will she live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with an imaginable apprehension of hysterics, but as she
      continued firm, and placed herself resolutely in his way, he relaxed his
      scrutiny, and said, with a smile, &ldquo;Oh, I think so. What made you think she
      would n't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself aside, and made way far him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she cried. She would have said more, but her indignation choked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not pass at once, and he did not seem troubled at her anger. &ldquo;Dr.
      Breen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I saw a good deal of pneumonia in the army, and I don't
      remember a single case that was saved by the anxiety of the surgeon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went now, as people do when they fancy themselves to have made a good
      point; and she heard him asking Barlow for Libby, outside, and then
      walking over the gravel toward the stable. At that moment she doubted and
      hated him so much that she world have been glad to keep Libby from talking
      or even smoking with him. But she relented a little toward him afterwards,
      when he returned and resumed the charge of his patient with the gentle,
      vigilant cheerfulness which she had admired in him from the first,
      omitting no care and betraying none. He appeared to take it for granted
      that Grace saw an improvement, but he recognized it by nothing explicit
      till he rose and said, &ldquo;I think I will leave Mrs. Maynard with you
      to-night, Dr. Breen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sick woman's eyes turned to him imploringly from her pillow, and Grace
      spoke the terror of both when she faltered in return, &ldquo;Are you&mdash;you
      are not going home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall sleep in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; she cried fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can call me if you wish. But there won't be any occasion. Mrs.
      Maynard is very much better.&rdquo; He waited to give, in a sort of
      absent-minded way, certain directions. Then he went out, and Grace sank
      back into the chair from which she had started at his rising, and wept
      long and silently with a hidden face. When she took away her hands and
      dried her tears, she saw Mrs. Maynard beckoning to her. She went to the
      bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; she asked tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stoop down,&rdquo; whispered the other; and as Grace bowed her ear Mrs. Maynard
      touched her cheek with her dry lips. In this kiss doubtless she forgave
      the wrong which she had hoarded in her heart, and there perverted into a
      deadly injury. But they both knew upon what terms the pardon was accorded,
      and that if Mrs. Maynard had died, she would have died holding Grace
      answerable for her undoing.

    <h2>
      IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the morning Dr. Mulbridge drove back to Corbitant, and in the evening
      Libby came over from New Leyden with Maynard, in a hired wagon. He was a
      day later than his wife had computed, but as she appeared to have
      reflected, she had left the intervening Sunday out of her calculation;
      this was one of the few things she taxed herself to say. For the rest, she
      seemed to be hoarding her strength against his coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace met him at a little distance from the house, whither she had walked
      with Bella, for a breath of the fresh air after her long day in the
      sick-room, and did not find him the boisterous and jovial Hoosier she had
      imagined him. It was, in fact, hardly the moment for the expression of
      Western humor. He arrived a sleep-broken, travel-creased figure, with more
      than the Western man's usual indifference to dress; with sad, dull eyes,
      and an untrimmed beard that hung in points and tags, and thinly hid the
      corners of a large mouth. He took her hand laxly in his, and bowing over
      her from his lank height listened to her report of his wife's state, while
      he held his little girl on his left arm, and the child fondly pressed her
      cheek against his bearded face, to which he had quietly lifted her as soon
      as he alighted from Libby's buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Libby introduced Grace as Dr. Breen, and drove on, and Maynard gave her
      the title whenever he addressed her, with a perfect effect of
      single-mindedness in his gravity, as if it were an every-day thing with
      him to meet young ladies who were physicians. He had a certain neighborly
      manner of having known her a long time, and of being on good terms with
      her; and somewhere there resided in his loosely knit organism a powerful
      energy. She had almost to run in keeping at his side, as he walked on to
      the house, carrying his little girl on his arm, and glancing about him;
      and she was not sure at last that she had succeeded in making him
      understand how serious the case had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether I ought to let you go in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;without
      preparing her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's been expecting me, has n't she?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she's awake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll just go in and prepare her myself. I'm a pretty good hand at
      preparing people to meet me. You've a beautiful location here, Dr. Breen;
      and your town has a chance to grow. I like to see a town have some
      chance,&rdquo; he added, with a sadness past tears in his melancholy eyes.
      &ldquo;Bella can show me the way to the room, I reckon,&rdquo; he said, setting the
      little one down on the piazza, and following her indoors; and when Grace
      ventured, later, to knock at the door, Maynard's voice bade her come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat beside his wife's pillow, with her hand in his left; on his right
      arm perched the little girl, and rested her head on his shoulder. They did
      not seem to have been talking, and they did not move when Grace entered
      the room. But, apparently, Mrs. Maynard had known how to behave to George
      Maynard, and peace was visibly between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you tell me about the medicines, Dr. Breen, and then you go and get
      some rest,&rdquo; said Maynard in his mild, soothing voice. &ldquo;I used to
      understand Mrs. Maynard's ways pretty well, and I can take care of her.
      Libby told me all about you and your doings, and I know you must feel as
      pale as you look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can't have had any sleep on the way,&rdquo; Grace began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep?&rdquo; Maynard repeated, looking wanly at her. &ldquo;I never sleep. I'd as
      soon think of digesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After she had given him the needed instructions he rose from the
      rocking-chair in-which he had been softly swinging to and fro, and
      followed her out into the corridor, caressing with his large hand the
      child that lay on his shoulder. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Mrs. Maynard is
      still very sick, and needs the greatest care and attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I understand that. But I reckon it will come out all right in the
      end,&rdquo; he said, with the optimistic fatalism which is the real religion of
      our orientalizing West. &ldquo;Good-night, doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went away, feeling suddenly alone in this exclusion from the cares
      that had absorbed her. There was no one on the piazza, which the moonlight
      printed with the shadows of the posts and the fanciful jigsaw work of the
      arches between them. She heard a step on the sandy walk round the corner,
      and waited wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Barlow who came in sight, as she knew at once, but she asked, &ldquo;Mr.
      Barlow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm,&rdquo; said Barlow. &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I thought it might be Mr. Libby at first. Do you know where he
      is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know where he ain't,&rdquo; said Barlow; and having ineffectually
      waited to be questioned further, he added, &ldquo;He ain't here, for one place.
      He's gone back to Leyden. He had to take that horse back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N' I guess he's goin' to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To stay? Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there you've got me again. All I know is I've got to drive that
      mare of his'n over to-morrow, if I can git off, and next day if I can't.
      Did n't you know he was goin'?&rdquo; asked Barlow, willing to recompense
      himself for the information he had given.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he added sympathetically, at a little hesitation of hers:
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she said, &ldquo;I knew he must go. Good-night, Mr. Barlow,&rdquo; and went
      indoors. She remembered that he had said he would go as soon as Maynard
      came, and that she had consented that this would be best. But his going
      now seemed abrupt, though she approved it. She thought that she had
      something more to say to him, which might console him or reconcile him;
      she could not think what this was, but it left an indefinite longing, an
      unsatisfied purpose in her heart; and there was somewhere a tremulous
      sense of support withdrawn. Perhaps this was a mechanical effect of the
      cessation of her anxiety for Mrs. Maynard, which had been a support as
      well as a burden. The house was strangely quiet, as if some great noise
      had just been hushed, and it seemed empty. She felt timid in her room, but
      she dreaded the next day more than the dark. Her life was changed, and the
      future, which she had once planned so clearly, and had felt so strong to
      encounter, had fallen to a ruin, in which she vainly endeavored to find
      some clew or motive of the past. She felt remanded to the conditions of
      the girlhood that she fancied she had altogether outlived; she turned her
      face upon her pillow in a grief of bewildered aspiration and broken pride,
      and shed tears scarcely predicable of a doctor of medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is no lapse or aberration of character which can be half so
      surprising to others as it is to one's self. She had resented Libby's
      treating her upon a theory, but she treated herself upon a theory, and we
      all treat ourselves upon a theory. We proceed each of us upon the theory
      that he is very brave, or generous, or gentle, or liberal, or truthful, or
      loyal, or just. We may have the defects of our virtues, but nothing is
      more certain than that we have our virtues, till there comes a fatal
      juncture, not at all like the juncture in which we had often imagined
      ourselves triumphing against temptation. It passes, and the hero finds, to
      his dismay and horror, that he has run away; the generous man has been
      niggard; the gentleman has behaved like a ruffian, and the liberal like a
      bigot; the champion of truth has foolishly and vainly lied; the steadfast
      friend has betrayed his neighbor, the just person has oppressed him. This
      is the fruitful moment, apparently so sterile, in which character may
      spring and flower anew; but the mood of abject humility in which the
      theorist of his own character is plunged and struggles for his lost
      self-respect is full of deceit for others. It cannot last: it may end in
      disowning and retrieving the error, or it may end in justifying it, and
      building it into the reconstructed character, as something upon the whole
      unexpectedly fine; but it must end, for after all it is only a mood. In
      such a mood, in the anguish of her disappointment at herself, a woman
      clings to whatever support offers, and it is at his own risk that the man
      who chances to be this support accepts the weight with which she casts
      herself upon him as the measure of her dependence, though he may make
      himself necessary to her, if he has the grace or strength to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without being able to understand fully the causes of the dejection in
      which this girl seemed to appeal to him, Mulbridge might well have
      believed himself the man to turn it in his favor. If he did not sympathize
      with her distress, or even clearly divine it, still his bold
      generalizations, he found, always had their effect with women, whose
      natures are often to themselves such unknown territory that a man who
      assumes to know them has gone far to master them. He saw that a rude moral
      force alone seemed to have a charm with his lady patients,&mdash;women who
      had been bred to ease and wealth, and who had cultivated, if not very
      disciplined, minds. Their intellectual dissipation had apparently made
      them a different race from the simpler-hearted womenkind of his neighbors,
      apt to judge men in a sharp ignorance of what is fascinating in heroes;
      and it would not be strange if he included Grace in the sort of
      contemptuous amusement with which he regarded these-flatteringly dependent
      and submissive invalids. He at least did not conceive of her as she
      conceived of herself; but this may be impossible to any man with regard to
      any woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his experience of other women's explicit and even eager obedience,
      the resistance which he had at first encountered in Grace gave zest to her
      final submission. Since he had demolished the position she had attempted
      to hold against him, he liked her for having imagined she could hold it;
      and she had continued to pique and interest him. He relished all her
      scruples and misgivings, and the remorse she had tried to confide to him;
      and if his enjoyment of these foibles of hers took too little account of
      her pain, it was never his characteristic to be tender of people in good
      health. He was, indeed, as alien to her Puritan spirit as if he had been
      born in Naples instead of Corbitant. He came of one of those families
      which one finds in nearly every New England community, as thoroughly New
      England in race as the rest, but flourishing in a hardy scepticism and
      contempt of the general sense. Whatever relation such people held to the
      old Puritan commonwealth when Puritanism was absolute, they must later
      have taken an active part in its disintegration, and were probably always
      a destructive force at its heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mulbridge's grandfather was one of the last captains who sailed a slaver
      from Corbitant. When this commerce became precarious, he retired from the
      seas, took a young wife in second marriage, and passed his declining days
      in robust inebriety. He lived to cast a dying vote for General Jackson,
      and his son, the first Dr. Mulbridge, survived to illustrate the
      magnanimity of his fellow-townsmen during the first year of the civil war,
      as a tolerated Copperhead. Then he died, and his son, who was in the West,
      looking up a location for practice, was known to have gone out as surgeon
      with one of the regiments there. It was not supposed that he went from
      patriotism; but when he came back, a year before the end of the struggle,
      and settled in his native place, his service in the army was accepted
      among his old neighbors as evidence of a better disposition of some sort
      than had hitherto been attributable to any of his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the lazy, good-natured boy, whom they chiefly remembered before
      his college days, had always been well enough liked among those who had
      since grown to be first mates and ship captains in the little port where
      he was born and grew up. They had now all retired from the sea, and,
      having survived its manifold perils, were patiently waiting to be drowned
      in sail-boats on the bay. They were of the second generation of ships'
      captains still living in Corbitant; but they would be the last. The
      commerce of the little port had changed into the whaling trade in their
      time; this had ceased in turn, and the wharves had rotted away. Dr.
      Mulbridge found little practice among them; while attending their
      appointed fate, they were so thoroughly salted against decay as to
      preserve even their families. But he gradually gathered into his hands,
      from the clairvoyant and the Indian doctor, the business which they had
      shared between them since his father's death. There was here and there a
      tragical case of consumption among the farming families along the coast,
      and now and then a frightful accident among the fishermen; the spring and
      autumn brought their typhoid; the city people who came down to the
      neighboring hotels were mostly sick, or fell sick; and with the small
      property his father had left, he and his mother contrived to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      They dwelt very harmoniously together; for his mother, who had passed more
      than a quarter of a century in strong resistance to her husband's will,
      had succumbed, as not uncommonly happens with such women, to the authority
      of her son, whom she had no particular pleasure or advantage in thwarting.
      In the phrase and belief of his neighbors, he took after her, rather than
      his father; but there was something ironical and baffling in him, which
      the local experts could not trace to either the Mulbridges or the
      Gardiners. They had a quiet, indifferent faith in his ability to make
      himself a position and name anywhere; but they were not surprised that he
      had come back to live in Corbitant, which was so manifestly the best place
      in the world, and which, if somewhat lacking in opportunity, was ample in
      the leisure they believed more congenial to him than success. Some of his
      lady patients at the hotels, who felt at times that they could not live
      without him, would have carried him back to the city with them by a gentle
      violence; but there was nothing in anything he said or did that betrayed
      ambition on his part. He liked to hear them talk, especially of their
      ideas of progress, as they called them, at which, with the ready
      adaptability of their sex, they joined him in laughing when they found
      that he could not take them seriously. The social, the emotional
      expression of the new scientific civilization struck him as droll,
      particularly in respect to the emancipation of women; and he sometimes
      gave these ladies the impression that he did not value woman's intellect
      at its true worth. He was far from light treatment of them, he was
      considerate of the distances that should be guarded; but he conveyed the
      sense of his scepticism as to their fitness for some things to which the
      boldest of them aspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother would have been willing to have him go to the city if he
      wished, but she was too ignorant of the world outside of Corbitant to
      guess at his possibilities in it, and such people as she had seen from it
      had not pleased her with it. Those summer-boarding lady patients who came
      to see him were sometimes suffered to wait with her till he came in, and
      they used to tell her how happy she must be to keep such a son with her,
      and twittered their patronage of her and her nice old-fashioned parlor,
      and their praises of his skill in such wise against her echoless silence
      that she conceived a strong repugnance for all their tribe, in which she
      naturally included Grace when she appeared. She had decided the girl to be
      particularly forth-putting, from something prompt and self-reliant in her
      manner that day; and she viewed with tacit disgust her son's toleration of
      a handsome young woman who had taken up a man's profession. They were not
      people who gossiped together, or confided in each other, and she would
      have known nothing and asked nothing from him about her, further than she
      had seen for herself. But Barlow had folks, as he called them, at
      Corbitant; and without her own connivance she had heard from them of all
      that was passing at Jocelyn's.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her fashion to approach any subject upon which she wished her son
      to talk as if they had already talked of it, and he accepted this
      convention with a perfect understanding that she thus expressed at once
      her deference to him and her resolution to speak whether he liked it or
      not. She had not asked him about Mrs. Maynard's sickness, or shown any
      interest in it; but after she learned from the Barlows that she was no
      longer in danger, she said to her son one morning, before he drove away
      upon his daily visit, &ldquo;Is her husband going to stay with her, or is he
      going back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, really,&rdquo; he answered, glancing at her where she sat erect
      across the table from him, with her hand on the lid of the coffee-pot, and
      her eyes downcast; it was the face of silent determination not to be put
      off, which he knew. &ldquo;I don't suppose you care, mother,&rdquo; he added
      pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's nothing to me,&rdquo; she assented. &ldquo;What's that friend of hers going to
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know. The one that came after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Dr. Breen. Yes. What did you think of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why you call her doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do it out of politeness. Besides, she is one sort of doctor. Little
      pills,&rdquo; he added, with an enjoyment of his mother's grimness on this
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see a daughter of mine pretending to be a doctor,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Mulbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you would n't like Dr. Breen for a daughter,&rdquo; returned her son, in
      the same tone as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wouldn't like me for a mother,&rdquo; Mrs. Mulbridge retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son laughed, and helped himself to more baked beans and a fresh slice
      of rye-and-Indian. He had the homely tastes and the strong digestion of
      the people from whom he sprung; and he handed his cup to be filled with
      his mother's strong coffee in easy defiance of consequences. As he took it
      back from her he said, &ldquo;I should like to see you and Mrs. Breen together.
      You would make a strong team.&rdquo; He buttered his bread, with another laugh
      in appreciation of his conceit. &ldquo;If you happened to pull the same way. If
      you did n't, something would break. Mrs. Breen is a lady of powerful
      convictions. She thinks you ought to be good, and you ought to be very
      sorry for it, but not so sorry as you ought to be for being happy. I don't
      think she has given her daughter any reason to complain on the last
      score.&rdquo; He broke into his laugh again, and watched his mother's frown with
      interest. &ldquo;I suspect that she does n't like me very well. You could meet
      on common ground there: you don't like her daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be a pair of them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mulbridge immovably. &ldquo;Did her
      mother like her studying for a doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I understand so. Her mother is progressive she believes in the
      advancement of women; she thinks the men would oppress them if they got a
      chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one half the bold things that are running about the country had
      masters it would be the best thing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mulbridge, opening the lid
      of the coffee-pot, and clapping it to with force, after a glance inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where Mrs. Green wouldn't agree with you. Perhaps because it would
      make the bold things happy to have masters, though she does n't say so.
      Probably she wants the women to have women doctors so they won't be so
      well, and can have more time to think whether they have been good or not.
      You ought to hear some of the ladies over there talk, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard enough of their talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you ought to hear Miss Gleason. There are very few things that Miss
      Gleason does n't think can be done with cut flowers, from a wedding to a
      funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mulbridge perceived that her son was speaking figuratively of Miss
      Gleason's sentimentality, but she was not very patient with the sketch he,
      enjoyed giving of her. &ldquo;Is she a friend of that Breen girl's?&rdquo; she
      interrupted to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's an humble friend, an admirer, a worshipper. The Breen girl is her
      ideal woman. She thinks the Breen girl is so superior to any man living
      that she would like to make a match for her.&rdquo; His mother glanced sharply
      at him, but he went on in the tone of easy generalization, and with a
      certain pleasure in the projection of these strange figures against her
      distorting imagination: &ldquo;You see, mother, that the most advanced thinkers
      among those ladies are not so very different, after all, from you
      old-fashioned people. When they try to think of the greatest good fortune
      that can befall an ideal woman, it is to have her married. The only
      trouble is to find a man good enough; and if they can't find one, they're
      apt to invent one. They have strong imaginations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think they would make you sick, amongst them,&rdquo; said his mother.
      &ldquo;Are you going to have anything more to eat?&rdquo; she asked, with a
      housekeeper's latent impatience to get her table cleared away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. Mulbridge; &ldquo;I have n't finished yet. And I'm in no hurry
      this morning. Sit still, mother; I want you to hear something more about
      my lady friends at Jocelyn's. Dr. Breen's mother and Miss Gleason don't
      feel alike about her. Her mother thinks she was weak in giving up Mrs.
      Maynard's case to me; but Miss Gleason told me about their discussion, and
      she thinks it is the great heroic act of Dr. Breen's life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It showed some sense, at least,&rdquo; Mrs. Mulbridge replied. She had tacitly
      offered to release her son from telling her anything when she had made her
      motion to rise; if he chose to go on now, it was his own affair. She
      handed him the plate of biscuit, and he took one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It showed inspiration, Miss Gleason says. The tears came into her eyes; I
      understood her to say it was godlike. 'And only to think, doctor,'&rdquo; he
      continued, with a clumsy, but unmistakable suggestion of Miss Gleason's
      perfervid manner, &ldquo;'that such a girl should be dragged down by her own
      mother to the level of petty, every-day cares and duties, and should be
      blamed for the most beautiful act of self-sacrifice! Is n't it too bad?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rufus, Rufus!&rdquo; cried his mother, &ldquo;I can't stun' it! Stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dr. Breen is n't so bad&mdash;not half so divine as Miss Gleason
      thinks her. And Mrs. Maynard does n't consider her surrendering the case
      an act of self-sacrifice at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope not!&rdquo; said Mrs. Mulbridge. &ldquo;I guess she would n't have been
      alive to tell the tale, if it had n't been for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can't be sure of that. You must n't believe too much in doctors,
      mother. Mrs. Maynard is pretty tough. And she's had wonderfully good
      nursing. You've only heard the Barlow side of the matter,&rdquo; said her sun,
      betraying now for the first time that he had been aware of any knowledge
      of it on her part. That was their way: though they seldom told each other
      anything, and went on as if they knew nothing of each other's affairs, yet
      when they recognized this knowledge it was without surprise on either
      side. &ldquo;I could tell you a different story. She's a very fine girl, mother;
      cool and careful under instruction, and perfectly tractable and
      intelligent. She's as different from those other women you've seen as you
      are. You would like her!&rdquo; He had suddenly grown earnest, and crushing the
      crust of a biscuit in the strong left hand which he rested on the table,
      he gazed keenly at her undemonstrative face. &ldquo;She's no baby, either. She's
      got a will and a temper of her own. She's the only one of them I ever saw
      that was worth her salt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you did n't like self-willed women,&rdquo; said his mother
      impassively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows when to give up,&rdquo; he answered, with unrelaxed scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother did not lift her eyes, yet. &ldquo;How long shall you have to visit
      over there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've made my last professional visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Jocelyn's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mulbridge now looked up, and met her son's eye. &ldquo;What makes you think
      she'll have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not shrink at her coming straight to the point the moment the way
      was clear. He had intended it, and he liked it. But he frowned a little as
      he said, &ldquo;Because I want her to have me, for one thing.&rdquo; His jaw closed
      heavily, but his face lost a certain brutal look almost as quickly as it
      had assumed it. &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; he said, with a smile, &ldquo;that it's the only
      reason I've got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You no need to say that,&rdquo; said his mother, resenting the implication that
      any woman would not have him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not pretty to look at, mother, and I'm not particularly young;
      and for a while I thought there might be some one, else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young fellow that came with her, that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That whipper-snapper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mulbridge assented by his silence. &ldquo;But I guess I was mistaken. I
      guess he's tried and missed it. The field is 'clear, for all I can see.
      And she's made a failure in one way, and then you know a woman is in the
      humor to try it in another. She wants a good excuse for giving up. That's
      what I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;I presume you know what you're about, Rufus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took up the coffee-pot on the lid of which she had been keeping her
      hand, and went into the kitchen with it. She removed the dishes, and left
      him sitting before the empty table-cloth. When she came for that, he took
      hold of her hand, and looked up into her face, over which a scarcely
      discernible tremor passed. &ldquo;Well, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's what I always knew I had got to come to, first or last. And I
      suppose I ought to feel glad enough I did n't have to come to it at
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said her son. &ldquo;I'm not a stripling any longer.&rdquo; He laughed, keeping
      his mother's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She freed it and taking up the table-cloth folded it lengthwise and then
      across, and laid it neatly away in the cupboard. &ldquo;I sha'n't interfere with
      you, nor any woman that you bring here to be your wife. I've had my day,
      and I'm not one of the old fools that think they're going to have and to
      hold forever. You've always been a good boy to me, and I guess you hain't
      ever had to complain' of your mother stan'in' in your way. I sha'n't now.
      But I did think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and shut her lips firmly. &ldquo;Speak up, mother!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I better not,&rdquo; she answered, setting her chair back against the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean. You mean about my laughing at women that try to
      take men's places in the world. Well, I did laugh at them. They're
      ridiculous. I don't want to marry this girl because she's a doctor. That
      was the principal drawback, in my mind. But it does n't make any
      difference, and wouldn't now, if she was a dozen doctors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother let down the leaves of the table, and pushed it against the
      wall, and he rose from the chair in which he was left sitting in the
      middle of the room. &ldquo;I presume,&rdquo; she said, with her back toward him, as
      she straightened the table accurately against the mopboard, &ldquo;that you can
      let me have the little house at Grant's Corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, mother!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You don't suppose I should ever let you be
      turned out of house and home? You can stay here as long as you live. But
      it has n't come to that, yet. I don't know that she cares anything about
      me. But there are chances, and there are signs. The chances are that she
      won't have the courage to take up her plan of life again, and that she'll
      consider any other that's pressed home upon her. And I take it for a good
      sign that she's sent that fellow adrift. If her mind had n't been set on
      some one else, she'd have taken him, in this broken-up state of hers.
      Besides, she has formed the habit of doing what I say, and there's a great
      deal in mere continuity of habit. It will be easier for her to say yes
      than to say no; it would be very hard for her to say no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he eagerly pressed these arguments his mother listened stonily,
      without apparent interest or sympathy. But at the end she asked, &ldquo;How are
      you going to support a wife? Your practice here won't do it. Has she got
      anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has property, I believe,&rdquo; replied her son. &ldquo;She seems to have been
      brought up in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won't want to come and live here, then. She'll have notions of her
      own. If she's like the rest of them, she'll never have you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she were like the rest of them, I'd never have her. But she is n't. As
      far as I'm concerned, it's nothing against her that she's studied
      medicine. She did n't do it from vanity, or ambition, or any abnormal love
      of it. She did it, so far so I can find out, because she wished to do good
      that way. She's been a little notional, she's had her head addled by
      women's talk, and she's in a queer freak; but it's only a girl's freak
      after all: you can't say anything worse of her. She's a splendid woman,
      and her property's neither here nor there. I could support her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume,&rdquo; replied his mother, &ldquo;that she's been used to ways that ain't
      like our ways. I've always stuck up for you, Rufus, stiff enough, I guess;
      but I ain't agoin' to deny that you're country born and bred. I can see
      that, and she can see it, too. It makes a great difference with girls. I
      don't know as she'd call you what they call a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mulbridge flushed angrily. Every American, of whatever standing or
      breeding, thinks of himself as a gentleman, and nothing can gall him more
      than the insinuation that he is less. &ldquo;What do you mean, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hain't ever been in such ladies' society as hers in the same way. I
      know that they all think the world of you, and flatter you up, and they're
      as biddable as you please when you're doctorin' 'em; but I guess it would
      be different if you was to set up for one of their own kind amongst 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is n't one of them,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;that I don't believe I could
      have for the turn of my hand, especially if it was doubled into a fist.
      They like force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you've only seen the sick married ones. I guess you'll find a well
      girl is another thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're all alike. And I think I should be something of a relief if I was
      n't like what she's been used to hearing called a gentleman; she'd prefer
      me on that account. But if you come to blood, I guess the Mulbridges and
      Gardiner, can hold up their heads with the best, anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, like the Camfers and Rafllins.&rdquo; These were people of ancestral
      consequence and local history, who had gone up to Boston from Corbitant,
      and had succeeded severally as green-grocers and retail dry-goods men,
      with the naturally attendant social distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; cried her son. &ldquo;If she cares for me at all, she won't care for
      the cut of my clothes, or my table manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's so. 'T ain't on my account that I want you should make sure
      she doos care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked hard at her immovable face, with its fallen eyes, and then went
      out of the room. He never quarrelled with his mother, because his anger,
      like her own, was dumb, and silenced him as it mounted. Her misgivings had
      stung him deeply, and at the bottom of his indolence and indifference was
      a fiery pride, not easily kindled, but unquenchable. He flung the harness
      upon his old unkempt horse, and tackled him to the mud-encrusted buggy,
      for whose shabbiness he had never cared before. He was tempted to go back
      into the house, and change his uncouth Canada homespun coat for the
      broadcloth frock which he wore when he went to Boston; but he scornfully
      resisted it, and drove off in his accustomed figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother's last words repeated themselves to him, and in that dialogue,
      in which he continued to dramatize their different feelings, he kept
      replying, &ldquo;Well, the way to find out whether she cares is to ask her.&rdquo;

    <p>
      During her convalescence Mrs. Maynard had the time and inclination to give
      Grace some good advice. She said that she had thought a great deal about
      it throughout her sickness, and she had come to the conclusion that Grace
      was throwing away her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not fit to be a doctor, Grace,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You're too nervous, and
      you're too conscientious. It is n't merely your want of experience. No
      matter how much experience you had, if you saw a case going wrong in your
      hands, you'd want to call in some one else to set it right. Do you suppose
      Dr. Mulbridge would have given me up to another doctor because he was
      afraid he couldn't cure me? No, indeed! He'd have let me die first, and I
      should n't have blamed him. Of course I know what pressure I brought to
      bear upon you, but you had no business to mind me. You oughtn't to have
      minded my talk any more than the buzzing of a mosquito, and no real doctor
      would. If he wants to be a success, he must be hard-hearted; as
      hard-hearted as&rdquo;&mdash;she paused for a comparison, and failing any other
      added&mdash;&ldquo;as all possessed.&rdquo; To the like large-minded and impartial
      effect, she, ran on at great length. &ldquo;No, Grace,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;what you
      want to do is to get married. You would be a good wife, and you would be a
      good mother. The only trouble is that I don't know any man worthy of you,
      or half worthy. No, I don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that her recovery was assured, Mrs. Maynard was very forgiving and
      sweet and kind with every one. The ladies who came in to talk with her
      said that she was a changed creature; she gave them all the best advice,
      and she had absolutely no shame whatever for the inconsistency involved by
      her reconciliation with her husband. She rather flaunted the happiness of
      her reunion in the face of the public, and she vouchsafed an explanation
      to no one. There had never been anything definite in her charges against
      him, even to Grace, and her tacit withdrawal of them succeeded perfectly
      well. The ladies, after some cynical tittering, forgot them, and rejoiced
      in the spectacle of conjugal harmony afforded them: women are generous
      creatures, and there is hardly any offence which they are not willing
      another woman should forgive her husband, when once they have said that
      they do not see how she could ever forgive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maynard's silence seemed insufficient to none but Mrs. Breen and her
      own husband. The former vigorously denounced its want of logic to Grace as
      all but criminal, though she had no objection to Mr. Maynard. He, in fact,
      treated her with a filial respect which went far to efface her
      preconceptions; and he did what he could to retrieve himself from the
      disgrace of a separation in Grace's eyes. Perhaps he thought that the late
      situation was known to her alone, when he casually suggested, one day,
      that Mrs. Maynard was peculiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Grace mercifully; &ldquo;but she has been out of health so long.
      That makes a great difference. She's going to be better now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's going to come out all right in the end,&rdquo; he said, with his
      unbuoyant hopefulness, &ldquo;and I reckon I've got to help it along. Why, I
      suppose every man's a trial at times, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say. I know that every woman is,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so? Well, may be you're partly right. But you don't suppose but
      what a man generally begins it, do you? There was Adam, you know. He did
      n't pull the apple; but he fell off into that sleep, and woke up with one
      of his ribs dislocated, and that's what really commenced the trouble. If
      it had n't been for Adam, there would n't have been any woman, you know;
      and you could n't blame her for what happened after she got going?&rdquo; There
      was no gleam of insinuation in his melancholy eye, and Grace listened
      without quite knowing what to make of it all. &ldquo;And then I suppose he was
      n't punctual at meals, and stood round talking politics at night, when he
      ought to have been at home with his family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adam,&rdquo; replied Mr. Maynard lifelessly. &ldquo;Well, they got along pretty well
      outside,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Some of the children didn't turn out just what
      you might have expected; but raising children is mighty uncertain
      business. Yes, they got along.&rdquo; He ended his parable with a sort of weary
      sigh, as if oppressed by experience. Grace looked at his slovenly figure,
      his smoky complexion, and the shaggy outline made by his untrimmed hair
      and beard, and she wondered how Louise could marry him; but she liked him,
      and she was willing to accept for all reason the cause of unhappiness at
      which he further hinted. &ldquo;You see, doctor, an incompatibility is a pretty
      hard thing to manage. You can't forgive it like a real grievance. You have
      to try other things, and find out that there are worse things, and then
      you come back to it and stand it. We're talking Wyoming and cattle range,
      now, and Mrs. Maynard is all for the new deal; it's going to make us
      healthy, wealthy, and wise. Well, I suppose the air will be good for her,
      out there. You doctors are sending lots of your patients our way, now.&rdquo;
       The gravity with which he always assumed that Grace was a physician in
      full and regular practice would have had its edge of satire, coming from
      another; but from him, if it was ironical, it was also caressing, and she
      did not resent it. &ldquo;I've had some talk with your colleague, here, Dr.
      Mulbridge, and he seems to think it will be the best thing for her. I
      suppose you agree with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;his opinion would be of great value. It wouldn't
      be at all essential that I should agree with him:'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know about that,&rdquo; said Maynard. &ldquo;I reckon he thinks a good
      deal of your agreeing with him. I've been talking with him about settling
      out our way. We've got a magnificent country, and there's bound to be
      plenty of sickness there, sooner or later. Why, doctor, it would be a good
      opening for you! It 's just the place for you. You 're off here in a
      corner, in New England, and you have n't got any sort of scope; but at
      Cheyenne you'd have the whole field to yourself; there is n't another lady
      doctor in Cheyenne. Now, you come out with us. Bring your mother with you,
      and grow up with the country. Your mother would like it. There's enough
      moral obliquity in Cheyenne to keep her conscience in a state of healthful
      activity all the time. Yes, you'd get along out there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace laughed, and shook her head. It was part of the joke which life
      seemed to be with Mr. Maynard that the inhabitants of New England were all
      eager to escape from their native section, and that they ought to be
      pitied and abetted in this desire. As soon as his wife's convalescence
      released him from constant attendance upon her, he began an inspection of
      the region from the compassionate point of view; the small, frugal
      husbandry appealed to his commiseration, and he professed to have found
      the use of canvas caps upon the haycocks intolerably pathetic. &ldquo;Why, I'm
      told,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that they have to blanket the apple-trees while the fruit
      is setting; and they kill off our Colorado bugs by turning them loose, one
      at a time, on the potato-patches: the bug starves to death in forty-eight
      hours. But you've got plenty of schoolhouses, doctor; it does beat all,
      about the schoolhouses. And it's an awful pity that there are no children
      to go to school in them. Why, of course the people go West as fast as they
      can, but they ought to be helped; the Government ought to do something.
      They're good people; make first-rate citizens when you get them waked up,
      out there. But they ought all to be got away, and let somebody run New
      England' as a summer resort. It's pretty, and it's cool and pleasant, and
      the fishing is excellent; milk, eggs, and all kinds of berries and
      historical associations on the premises; and it could be made very
      attractive three months of the year; but my goodness! you oughtn't to ask
      anybody to live here. You come out with us, doctor, and see that country,
      and you'll know what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His boasts were always uttered with a wan, lack-lustre irony, as if he
      were burlesquing the conventional Western brag and enjoying the
      mystifications of his listener, whose feeble sense of humor often failed
      to seize his intention, and to whom any depreciation of New England was
      naturally unintelligible. She had not come to her final liking for him
      without a season of serious misgiving, but after that she rested in peace
      upon what every one knowing him felt to be his essential neighborliness.
      Her wonder had then come to be how he could marry Louise, when they sat
      together on the seaward piazza, and he poured out his easy talk, unwearied
      and unwearying, while, with one long, lank leg crossed upon the other, he
      swung his unblacked, thin-soled boot to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he was this kind of a fellow: When we were in Switzerland, he was
      always climbing some mountain or other. They could n't have hired me to
      climb one of their mountains if they'd given me all their scenery, and
      thrown their goitres in. I used to tell him that the side of a house was
      good enough for me. But nothing but the tallest mountains would do him;
      and one day when he was up there on the comb of the roof somewhere, tied
      with a rope round his waist to the guide and a Frenchman, the guide's foot
      slipped, and he commenced going down. The Frenchman was just going to cut
      the rope and let the guide play it alone; but he knocked the knife out of
      his hand with his long-handled axe, and when the jerk came he was on the
      other side of the comb, where he could brace himself, and brought them
      both up standing. Well, he's got muscles like bunches of steel wire. Did
      n't he ever tell you about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Grace sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, somebody ought to expose Libby. I don't suppose I should ever have
      known about it myself, if I hadn't happened to see the guide's friends and
      relations crying over him next day as if he was the guide's funeral.
      Hello! There's the doctor.&rdquo; He unlimbered his lank legs, and rose with an
      effect of opening his person like a pocket-knife. &ldquo;As I understand it,
      this is an unprofessional visit, and the doctor is here among us as a
      guest. I don't know exactly what to do under the circumstances, whether we
      ought to talk about Mrs. Maynard's health or the opera; but I reckon if we
      show our good intentions it will come out all right in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went forward to meet the doctor, who came up to shake hands with Grace,
      and then followed him in-doors to see Mrs. Maynard. Grace remained in her
      place, and she was still sitting there when Dr. Mulbridge returned without
      him. He came directly to her, and said, &ldquo;I want to speak with you, Miss
      Breen. Can I see you alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is Mrs. Maynard worse?&rdquo; she asked, rising in a little
      trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it has nothing to do with her. She's practically well now; I can
      remand the case to you. I wish to see you&mdash;about yourself.&rdquo; She
      hesitated at this peculiar summons, but some pressure was upon her to obey
      Dr. Mulbridge, as there was upon most people where he wished to obey him.
      &ldquo;I want to talk with you,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;about what you are going to do,&mdash;about
      your future. Will you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she answered; and she suffered him to lead the way down from
      the piazza, and out upon one of the sandy avenues toward the woods, in
      which it presently lost itself. &ldquo;But there will be very little to talk
      about,&rdquo; she continued, as they moved away, &ldquo;if you confine yourself to my
      future. I have none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how you've got rid of it,&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;You've got a future
      as much as you have a past, and there's this advantage,&mdash;that you can
      do something with your future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; she asked, with a little bitterness. &ldquo;That has n't been
      my experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been mine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you can make it yours. Come, I want to
      talk with you about your future, because I have been thinking very
      seriously about my own. I want to ask your advice and to give you mine.
      I'll commence by asking yours. What do you think of me as a physician? I
      know you are able to judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was flattered, in spite of herself. There were long arrears of cool
      indifference to her own claims in that direction, which she might very
      well have resented; but she did not. There was that flattery in his
      question which the junior in any vocation feels in the appeal of his
      senior; and there was the flattery which any woman feels in a man's
      recourse to her judgment. Still, she contrived to parry it with a little
      thrust. &ldquo;I don't suppose the opinion of a mere homoeopathist can be of any
      value to a regular practitioner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;You have been a regular practitioner yourself for the last
      three weeks. What do you think of my management of the case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never abandoned my principles,&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know all about that? What do you think of me as a doctor?&rdquo; he
      persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I admire you. Why do you ask me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wished to know. And because I wished to ask you something else.
      You have been brought up in a city, and I have always lived here in the
      country, except the two years I was out with the army. Do you think I
      should succeed if I pulled up here, and settled in Boston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not lived in Boston,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;My opinion wouldn't be worth
      much on that point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it would. You know city people, and what they are. I have seen a
      good deal of them in my practice at the hotels about here, and some of the
      ladies&mdash;when they happened to feel more comfortable&mdash;have
      advised me to come to Boston.&rdquo; His derision seemed to throw contempt on
      all her sex; but he turned to her, and asked again earnestly, &ldquo;What do you
      think? Some of the profession know me there. When I left the school, some
      of the faculty urged me to try my chance in the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited a moment before she answered. &ldquo;You know that I must respect
      your skill, and I believe that you could succeed anywhere. I judge your
      fitness by my own deficiency. The first time I saw you with Mrs. Maynard,
      I saw that you had everything that I hadn't. I saw that I was a failure,
      and why, and that it would be foolish for me to keep up the struggle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you have given it up?&rdquo; he demanded, with a triumph in
      which there was no sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has given me up. I never liked it,&mdash;I told you that before,&mdash;and
      I never took it up from any ambitious motive. It seemed a shame for me to
      be of no use in the world; and I hoped that I might do something in a way
      that seemed natural for women. And I don't give up because I'm unfit as a
      woman. I might be a man, and still be impulsive and timid and nervous, and
      everything that I thought I was not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you might be all that, and be a man; but you'd be an exceptional
      man, and I don't think you're an exceptional woman. If you've failed, it
      is n't your temperament that's to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is. The wrong is somewhere in me individually. I know it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mulbridge, walking beside her, with his hands clasped behind him,
      threw up his head and laughed. &ldquo;Well, have it your own way, Miss Breen.
      Only I don't agree with you. Why should you wish to spare your sex at your
      own expense? But that's the way with some ladies, I've noticed. They
      approve of what women attempt because women attempt it, and they believe
      the attempt reflects honor on them. It's tremendous to think what men
      could accomplish for their sex, if they only hung together as women do.
      But they can't. They haven't the generosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you don't understand me,&rdquo; said Grace, with a severity that amused
      him. &ldquo;I wished to regard myself, in taking up this profession, entirely as
      I believed a man would have regarded himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And were you able to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she unintentionally replied to this unexpected question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haw, haw, haw!&rdquo; laughed Dr. Mulbridge at her helpless candor. &ldquo;And are
      you sure that you give it up as a man would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how you mean,&rdquo; she said, vexed and bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you do it fairly and squarely because you believe that you're a
      failure, or because you partly feel that you have n't been fairly dealt
      with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that if Mrs. Maynard had had the same confidence in me that she
      would have had in any man I should not have failed. But every woman
      physician has a double disadvantage that I hadn't the strength to
      overcome,&mdash;her own inexperience and the distrust of other women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whose fault is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the men's. It is the men alone who give women any chance. They are
      kind and generous and liberal-minded. I have no blame for them, and I have
      no patience with women who want to treat them as the enemies of women's
      advancement. Women can't move a step forwards without their sufferance and
      help. Dr. Mulbridge,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I wish to apologize for the hasty and
      silly words I used to you the day I came to ask you to consult with me. I
      ought to have been grateful to you for consenting at first, and when you
      took back your consent I ought to have considered your position. You were
      entirely right. We had no common ground to meet on, and I behaved like a
      petulant, foolish, vulgar girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he protested, laughing in recollection of the scene. &ldquo;You were
      all right, and I was in a fix; and if your own fears had n't come to the
      rescue, I don't know how I should have got out of it. It would have been
      disgraceful, wouldn't it, to refuse a lady's request. You don't know how
      near I was to giving way. I can tell you, now that it's all over. I had
      never seen a lady of our profession before,&rdquo; he added hastily, &ldquo;and my
      curiosity was up. I always had my doubts about the thoroughness of women's
      study, and I should have liked to see where your training failed. I must
      say I found it very good,&mdash;I've told you that. You wouldn't fail
      individually: you would fail because you are a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe that,&rdquo; said Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, because your patients are women. It's all one. What will you
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not do anything. I shall give it all up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what shall you do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to be? A fashionable woman? Or are you going to
      Europe, and settle down there with the other American failures? I've heard
      about them,&mdash;in Rome and Florence and Paris. Are you going to throw
      away the study you've put into this profession? You took it up because you
      wanted to do good. Don't you want to do good any more? Has the human race
      turned out unworthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She cowered at this arraignment, in which she could not separate the
      mocking from the justice. &ldquo;What do you advise me to do? Do you think I
      could ever succeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could never succeed alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know that; I felt that from the first. But I have planned to unite
      with a woman physician older than myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And double your deficiency. Sit down here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I wish to talk
      business.&rdquo; They had entered the border of the woods encompassing
      Jocelyn's, and he painted to a stump, beside which lay the fallen tree.
      She obeyed mechanically, and he remained standing near her, with one foot
      lifted to the log; he leaned forward over her, and seemed to seize a
      physical advantage in the posture. &ldquo;From your own point of view, you would
      have no right to give up your undertaking if there was a chance of success
      in it. You would have no more right to give up than a woman who had gone
      out as a missionary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't pretend to compare myself with such a woman; but I should have no
      more right to give up,&rdquo; she answered, helpless against the logic of her
      fate, which he had somehow divined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, listen to me. I can give you this chance. Are you satisfied
      that with my advice you could have succeeded in Mrs. Maynard's case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so. But what&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, too. Don't rise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His will overcame the impulse that had betrayed itself, and she sank back
      to her seat. &ldquo;I offer you my advice from this time forward; I offer you my
      help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very good of you,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;and I appreciate your
      generosity more than I can say. I know the prejudice you must have had to
      overcome in regard to women physicians before you could bring yourself to
      do this; and I know how you must have despised me for failing in my
      attempt, and giving myself up to my feeble temperament. But&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we won't speak of all that,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;Of course I felt the
      prejudice against women entering the profession which we all feel; it was
      ridiculous and disgusting to me till I saw you. I won't urge you from any
      personal motive to accept my offer. But I know that if you do you can
      realize all your hopes of usefulness; and I ask you to consider that
      certainly. But you know the only way it could be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked him in the eyes, with dismay in her growing intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that I ask you to let me help you carry out your plan of life, and
      to save all you have done, and all you have hoped, from waste&mdash;as
      your husband. Think&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She struggled to her feet as if he were opposing a palpable resistance, so
      strongly she felt the pressure of his will. &ldquo;It can't be, Dr. Mulbridge.
      Oh, it can't, indeed! Let us go back; I wish to go back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had planted himself in her way, and blocked her advance, unless she
      chose to make it a flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected this,&rdquo; he said, with a smile, as if her wild trepidation
      interested him as an anticipated symptom. &ldquo;The whole idea is new and
      startling to you. But I know you won't dismiss it abruptly, and I won't be
      discouraged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you must! I will not think of it! I can't! I do dismiss it at
      once. Let me go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you really choose to be like the rest,&mdash;a thing of hysterical
      impulses, without conscience or reason! I supposed the weakest woman would
      be equal to an offer of marriage. And you had dreamt of being a physician
      and useful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; she cried, half quelled by his derision, &ldquo;that I have found
      out that I am not fit for it,&mdash;that I am a failure and a disgrace;
      and you had no right to expect me to be anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are no failure, and I had a right to expect anything of you after the
      endurance and the discretion you have shown in the last three weeks.
      Without your help I should have failed myself. You owe it to other women
      to go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must take care of themselves,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If my weakness throws
      shame on them, they must bear it. I thank you for what you say. I believe
      you mean it. But if I was of any use to you I did n't know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was probably inspiration, then,&rdquo; he interrupted coolly. &ldquo;Come, this
      isn't a thing to be frightened at. You're not obliged to do what I say.
      But I think you ought to hear me out. I haven't spoken without serious
      thought, and I didn't suppose you would reject me without a reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reason?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;There is no reason in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ought to be. There is, on my side. I have all kinds of reasons for
      asking you to be my wife: I believe that I can make you happy in the
      fulfilment of your plans; I admire you and respect you more than any other
      woman I ever saw; and I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't love you, and that is reason enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, between boys and girls. But between men and women it isn't enough.
      Do you dislike me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I repulsive in any way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that I am not very young and that I am not very good-looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is n't that at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know that such things weigh with women, and that personal
      traits and habits are important in an affair like this. I am slovenly and
      indifferent about my dress; but it's only because I have lived where every
      sort of spirit and ambition was useless. I don't know about city ways, but
      I could pick up all of them that were worth while. I spoke of going to
      Boston; but I would go anywhere else with you, east or west, that you
      chose, and I know that I should succeed. I haven't done what I might have
      done with myself, because I've never had an object in life. I've always
      lived in the one little place, and I've never been out of it except when I
      was in the army. I've always liked my profession; but nothing has seemed
      worth while. You were a revelation to me; you have put ambition and hope
      into me. I never saw any woman before that I would have turned my hand to
      have. They always seemed to me fit to be the companions of fools, or the
      playthings of men. But of all the simpletons, the women who were trying to
      do something for woman, as they called it, trying to exemplify and
      illustrate a cause, were the silliest that I came across. I never happened
      to have met a woman doctor before you came to me; but I had imagined them,
      and I could n't believe in you when I saw you. You were not
      supersensitive, you were not presumptuous, and you gave up, not because
      you distrusted yourself, but because your patient distrusted you. That was
      right: I should have done the same thing myself. Under my direction, you
      have shown yourself faithful, docile, patient, intelligent beyond anything
      I have seen. I have watched you, and I know; and I know what your peculiar
      trials have been from that woman. You have taught me a lesson,&mdash;I 'm
      not ashamed to say it; and you've given me a motive. I was wrong to ask
      you to marry me so that you might carry out your plans: that was no way to
      appeal to you. What I meant was that I might make your plans my own, and
      that we might carry them out together. I don't care for making money; I
      have always been poor, and I had always expected to be so; and I am not
      afraid of hard work. There is n't any self-sacrifice you've dreamed of
      that I wouldn't gladly and proudly share with you. You can't do anything
      by yourself, but we could do anything together. If you have any scruple
      about giving up your theory of medicine, you needn't do it; and the State
      Medical Association may go to the devil. I've said my say. What do you
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked all round, as if seeking escape from a mesh suddenly flung
      about her, and then she looked imploringly up at him. &ldquo;I have nothing to
      say,&rdquo; she whispered huskily. &ldquo;I can't answer you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's all I ask,&rdquo; he said, moving a few steps, away, and suffering
      her to rise. &ldquo;Don't answer me now. Take time,&mdash;all the time you want,
      all the time there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, rising, and gathering some strength from the sense of
      being on foot again. &ldquo;I don't mean that. I mean that I don't&mdash;I can't
      consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't believe in me? You don't think I would do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe in myself. I have no right to doubt you. I know that I
      ought to honor you for what you propose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it calls for any great honor. Of course I shouldn't propose
      it to every lady physician.&rdquo; He smiled with entire serenity and
      self-possession. &ldquo;Tell me one thing: was there ever a time when you would
      have consented?&rdquo; She did not answer. &ldquo;Then you will consent yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Don't deceive yourself. I shall never consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll leave that to the logic of your own conscience. You will do what
      seems your duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must n't trust to my conscience. I fling it away! I won't have
      anything to do with it. I've been tortured enough by it. There is no sense
      or justice in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed easily at her vehemence. &ldquo;I 'll trust your conscience. But I
      won't stay to worry you now. I'm coming again day after to-morrow, and I'm
      not afraid of what you will say then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and left her, tearing his way through the sweet-fern and low
      blackberry vines, with long strides, a shape of uncouth force. After he
      was out of sight, she followed, scared and trembling at herself, as if she
      had blasphemed.

    <h2>
      XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Grace burst into the room where her mother sat; and flung her hat aside
      with a desperate gesture. &ldquo;Now, mother, you have got to listen to me. Dr.
      Mulbridge has asked me to marry him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Green put up her spectacles on her forehead, and stared at her
      daughter, while some strong expressions, out of the plebeian or rustic
      past which lies only a generation or two behind most of us, rose to her
      lips. I will not repeat them here; she had long denied them to herself as
      an immoral self-indulgence, and it must be owned that such things have a
      fearful effect, coming from old ladies. &ldquo;What has got into all the men?
      What in nature does he want you to marry him for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for the best reasons in the world,&rdquo; exclaimed the daughter. &ldquo;For
      reasons that will make you admire and respect him,&rdquo; she added ironically.
      &ldquo;For great, and unselfish, and magnanimous reasons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should want to believe they were the real ones, first,&rdquo; interrupted
      Mrs. Breen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants to marry me because he knows that I can't fulfil my plans of
      life alone, and because we could fulfil them together. We shall not only
      be husband and wife, but we shall be physicians in partnership. I may
      continue a homoeopath, he says, and the State Medical Association may go
      to the devil.&rdquo; She used his language, that would have been shocking to her
      ordinary moods, without blenching, and in their common agitation her
      mother accepted it as fit and becoming. &ldquo;He counts upon my accepting him
      because I must see it as my duty, and my conscience won't let me reject
      the only opportunity I shall have of doing some good and being of some use
      in the world. What do you think I ought to do, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's reason in what he says. It is an opportunity. You could be of
      use, in that way, and perhaps it's the only way. Yes,&rdquo; she continued,
      fascinated by the logic of the position, and its capabilities for
      vicarious self-sacrifice. &ldquo;I don't see how you can get out of it: You have
      spent years and years of study, and a great deal of money, to educate
      yourself for a profession that you're too weak to practise alone. You
      can't say that I ever advised your doing it. It was your own idea, and I
      did n't oppose it. But when you've gone so far, you've formed an
      obligation to go on. It's your duty not to give up, if you know of any
      means to continue. That's your duty, as plain as can be. To say nothing of
      the wicked waste of your giving up now, you're bound to consider the
      effect it would have upon other women who are trying to do something for
      themselves. The only thing,&rdquo; she added, with some misgiving, &ldquo;is whether
      you believe he was in earnest and would keep his word to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he was secretly laughing at me, and that he would expect to laugh
      me out of his promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you ought to take time to reflect, and you ought to be sure
      that you're right about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what you really think, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am always governed by reason, Grace, and by right; and I have brought
      you up on that plan. If you have ever departed from it, it has not been
      with my consent, nor for want of my warning. I have simply laid the matter
      before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you wish me to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was perhaps a point that had not occurred to Mrs. Breen in her
      recognition of the strength of Dr. Mulbridge's position. It was one thing
      to trace the path of duty; another to support the aspirant in treading it.
      &ldquo;You ought to take time to reflect,&rdquo; Mrs. Green repeated, with evasion
      that she never used in behalf of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother,&rdquo; answered Grace, &ldquo;I didn't take time to reflect, and I
      should n't care whether I was right about him or not. I refused him
      because I did n't love him. If I had loved him that would have been the
      only reason I needed to marry him. But all the duty in the world wouldn't
      be enough without it. Duty? I am sick of duty! Let the other women who are
      trying to do something for themselves, take care of themselves as men
      would. I don't owe them more than a man would owe other men, and I won't
      be hoodwinked into thinking I do. As for the waste, the past is gone, at
      any rate; and the waste that I lament is the years I spent in working
      myself up to an undertaking that I was never fit for. I won't continue
      that waste, and I won't keep up the delusion that because I was very
      unhappy I was useful, and that it was doing good to be miserable. I like
      pleasure and I like dress; I like pretty things. There is no harm in them.
      Why should n't I have them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is harm in them for you,&rdquo;&mdash;her mother began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have tried to make my life a horror? There is no other reason,
      and that is no reason. When we go into Boston this winter I shall go to
      the theatre. I shall go to the opera, and I hope there will be a ballet.
      And next summer, I am going to Europe; I am going to Italy.&rdquo; She whirled
      away toward the door as if she were setting out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you had taken leave of your conscience!&rdquo; cried her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I have, mother. I am going to consult my reason after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reason!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, my inclination. I have had enough of conscience,&mdash;of my
      own, and of yours, too. That is what I told him, and that is what I mean.
      There is such a thing as having too much conscience, and of getting
      stupefied by it, so that you can't really see what's right. But I don't
      care. I believe I should like to do wrong for a while, and I will do wrong
      if it's doing right to marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had her hand on the door-knob, and now she opened the door, and closed
      it after her with something very like a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      She naturally could not keep within doors in this explosive state, and she
      went downstairs, and out upon the piazza. Mr. Maynard was there, smoking,
      with his boots on top of the veranda-rail, and his person thrown back in
      his chair at the angle requisite to accomplish this elevation of the feet.
      He took them down, as he saw her approach, and rose, with the respect in
      which he never failed for women, and threw his cigar away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Maynard,&rdquo; she asked abruptly, &ldquo;do you know where Mr. Libby is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't, doctor, I'm sorry to say. If I did, I would send and borrow
      some more cigars of him. I think that the brand our landlord keeps must
      have been invented by Mr. Track, the great anti-tobacco reformer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he coming back? Is n't he coming back?&rdquo; she demanded breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I reckon he must be coming back. Libby generally sees his
      friends through. And he'll have some curiosity to know how Mrs. Maynard
      and I have come out of it all.&rdquo; He looked at her with something latent in
      his eye; but what his eye expressed was merely a sympathetic regret that
      he could not be more satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;Mr. Barlow might know something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said Maynard, &ldquo;perhaps he might, that very thing. I'll go
      round and ask him.&rdquo; He went to the stable, and she waited for his return.
      &ldquo;Barlow says,&rdquo; he reported, &ldquo;that he guesses he's somewhere about Leyden.
      At any rate, his mare's there yet, in the stable where Barlow left her.
      He saw her there, yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. That's all I wished to know,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;I wished to write to
      him,&rdquo; she added boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shut herself in her room and spent the rest of the forenoon in writing
      a letter, which when first finished was very long, but in its ultimate
      phase was so short as to occupy but a small space on a square
      correspondence-card. Having got it written on the card, she was
      dissatisfied with it in that shape, and copied it upon a sheet of
      note-paper. Then she sealed and addressed it, and put it into her pocket;
      after dinner she went down to the beach, and walked a long way upon the
      sands. She thought at first that she would ask Barlow to get it to him,
      somehow; and then she determined to find out from Barlow the address of
      the people who had Mr. Libby's horse, and send it to them for him by the
      driver of the barge. She would approach the driver with a nonchalant,
      imperious air, and ask him to please have that delivered to Mr. Libby
      immediately; and in case he learned from the stable-people that he was not
      in Leyden, to bring the letter back to her. She saw how the driver would
      take it, and then she figured Libby opening and reading it. She sometimes
      figured him one way, and sometimes another. Sometimes he rapidly scanned
      the lines, and then instantly ordered his horse, and feverishly hastened
      the men; again he deliberately read it, and then tore it into stall
      pieces, with a laugh, and flung them away. This conception of his behavior
      made her heart almost stop beating; but there was a luxury in it, too, and
      she recurred to it quite as often as to the other, which led her to a
      dramatization of their meeting, with all their parley minutely realized,
      and every most intimate look and thought imagined. There is of course no
      means of proving that this sort of mental exercise was in any degree an
      exercise of the reason, or that Dr. Breen did not behave unprofessionally
      in giving herself up to it. She could only have claimed in self-defence
      that she was no longer aiming at a professional behavior; that she was in
      fact abandoning herself to a recovered sense of girlhood and all its
      sweetest irresponsibilities. Those who would excuse so weak and capricious
      a character may urge, if they like, that she was behaving as wisely as a
      young physician of the other sex would have done in the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      She concluded to remain on the beach, where only the children were playing
      in the sand, and where she could easily escape any other companionship
      that threatened. After she had walked long enough to spend the first
      passion of her reverie, she sat down under the cliff, and presently grew
      conscious of his boat swinging at anchor in its wonted place, and wondered
      that she had not thought he must come back for that. Then she had a mind
      to tear up her letter as superfluous; but she did not. She rose from her
      place under the cliff, and went to look for the dory. She found it drawn
      up on the sand in a little cove. It was the same place, and the water was
      so shoal for twenty feet out that no one could have rowed the dory to
      land; it must be dragged up. She laughed and blushed, and then boldly
      amused herself by looking for footprints; but the tide must have washed
      them out long ago; there were only the light, small footprints of the
      children who had been playing about the dory. She brushed away some sand
      they had scattered over the seat, and got into the boat and sat down
      there. It was a good seat, and commanded a view of the sail-boat in the
      foreground of the otherwise empty ocean; she took out her letter, and let
      it lie in the open hands which she let lie in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not impatient to have the time pass; it went only too soon. Though
      she indulged that luxury of terror in imagining her letter torn up and
      scornfully thrown away, she really rested quite safe as to the event; but
      she liked this fond delay, and the soft blue afternoon might have lasted
      forever to her entire content.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little whiff of breeze stole up, and suddenly caught the letter from her
      open hands, and whisked it out over the sand. With a cry she fled after
      it, and when she had recaptured it, she thought to look at her watch. It
      was almost time for the barge, and now she made such needless haste, in
      order not to give herself chance for misgiving or retreat, that she
      arrived too soon at the point where she meant to intercept the driver on
      his way to the house; for in her present mutiny she had resolved to
      gratify a little natural liking for manoeuvre, long starved by the rigid
      discipline to which she had subjected herself. She had always been awkward
      at it, but she liked it; and now it pleased her to think that she should
      give her letter secretly to the driver, and on her way to meet him she
      forgot that she had meant to ask Barlow for part of the address. She did
      not remember this till it was too late to go back to the hotel, and she
      suddenly resolved not to consult Barlow, but to let the driver go about
      from one place to another with the letter till he found the right one. She
      kept walking on out into the forest through which the road wound, and she
      had got a mile away before she saw the weary bowing of the horses' heads
      as they tugged the barge through the sand at a walk. She stopped
      involuntarily, with some impulses to flight; and as the vehicle drew
      nearer, she saw the driver turned round upon his seat, and talking to a
      passenger behind. She had never counted upon his having a passenger, and
      the fact undid all.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained helpless in the middle of the road; the horses came to a
      stand-still a few paces from her, and the driver ceased from the high key
      of conversation, and turned to see what was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grief!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;If it had n't been for them horses o' mine, I
      sh'd 'a' run right over ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to speak with you,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I wished to send&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, and the passenger leaned forward to learn what was going on.
      &ldquo;Miss Breen!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and leaped out of the back of the barge and
      ran to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you got my letter!&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! What letter? Is there anything the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer. She had become conscious of the letter, which she had
      never ceased to hold in the hand that she had kept in her pocket for that
      purpose. She crushed it into a small wad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Libby turned his head, and said to the driver of the barge, &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take my arm?&rdquo; he added to her. &ldquo;It's heavy walking in this
      sand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; she murmured, recoiling. &ldquo;I'm not tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you well? Have you been quite well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, perfectly. I did n't know you were coming back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I had to come back. I'm going to Europe next week, and I had to come
      to look after my boat, here; and I wanted to say good-by to Maynard. I was
      just going to speak to Maynard, and then sail my boat over to Leyden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be very pleasant,&rdquo; she said, without looking at him. &ldquo;It's
      moonlight now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I sha'n't have any use for the moon. I shall get over before
      nightfall, if this breeze holds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried to think of something else, and to get away from this talk of a
      sail to Leyden, but she fatally answered, &ldquo;I saw your boat this afternoon.
      I had n't noticed before that it was still here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated a moment, and then asked, &ldquo;Did you happen to notice the
      dory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was drawn up on the sand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's all right&mdash;if it's in the same place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed to be,&rdquo; she answered faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to give the boat to Johnson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not say anything, for she could think of nothing to say, but that
      she had looked for seals on the reef, but had not seen any, and this would
      have been too shamelessly leading. That left the word to him, and he asked
      timidly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope my coming don't seem intrusive, Miss Breen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not heed this, but &ldquo;You are going to be gone a great while?&rdquo; she
      asked, in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; he replied, in an uncertain tone, as if troubled to make
      out whether she was vexed with him or not. &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I would
      go up the Nile this time. I've never been up the Nile, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't know that. Well,&rdquo; she added to herself, &ldquo;I wish you had not
      come back! You had better not have come back. If you had n't come, you
      would have got my letter. And now it can never be done! No, I can't go
      through it all again, and no one has the right to ask it. We have missed
      the only chance,&rdquo; she cried to herself, in such keen reproach of him that
      she thought she must have spoken aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mrs. Maynard all right again?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is very much better,&rdquo; she answered, confusedly, as if he had
      heard her reproach and had ignored it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you're not so tired as you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I 'm not tired now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you looked a little pale,&rdquo; he said sympathetically, and now she
      saw that he was so. It irritated her that she should be so far from him,
      in all helpfulness, and she could scarcely keep down the wish that ached
      in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are never nearer doing the thing we long to do than when we have
      proclaimed to ourselves that it must not and cannot be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so pale?&rdquo; she demanded, almost angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I didn't know that I was,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I supposed I was pretty well.
      I dare say I ought to be ashamed of showing it in that way. But if you ask
      me, well, I will tell you; I don't find it any easier than I did at
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to blame, then!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;If I were a man, I should not let
      such a thing wear upon me for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I dare say I shall live through it,&rdquo; he answered, with the national
      whimsicality that comes to our aid in most emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little pang went through her heart, but she retorted, &ldquo;I would n't go to
      Europe to escape it, nor up the Nile. I would stay and fight it where I
      was.&rdquo; &ldquo;Stay?&rdquo; He seemed to have caught hopefully at the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were stronger. If you give up in this way how can you
      expect me&rdquo;&mdash;She stopped; she hardly knew what she had intended to
      say; she feared that he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he only said: &ldquo;I'm sorry. I didn't intend to trouble you with the
      sight of me. I had a plan for getting over the cliff without letting you
      know, and having Maynard come down to me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you really mean,&rdquo; she cried piteously, &ldquo;to go away without trying
      to see me again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he owned simply. &ldquo;I thought I might catch a glimpse of you, but I
      did n't expect to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hate me so badly as that? What had I done to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done?&rdquo; He gave a sorrowful laugh; and added, with an absent air, &ldquo;Yes,
      it's really like doing something to me! And sometimes it seems as if you
      had done it purposely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I did n't! Now, then,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you have insulted me, and you
      never did that before. You were very good and noble and generous, and
      would n't let me blame myself for anything. I wanted always to remember
      that of you; for I did n't believe that any man could be so magnanimous.
      But it seems that you don't care to have me respect you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Respect?&rdquo; he repeated, in the same vague way. &ldquo;No, I should n't care
      about that unless it was included in the other. But you know whether I
      have accused you of anything, or whether I have insulted you. I won't
      excuse myself. I think that ought to be insulting to your common sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why should you have wished to avoid seeing me to-day? Was it to
      spare yourself?&rdquo; she demanded, quite incoherently now. &ldquo;Or did you think I
      should not be equal to the meeting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what to say to you,&rdquo; answered the young man. &ldquo;I think I must
      be crazy.&rdquo; He halted, and looked at her in complete bewilderment. &ldquo;I don't
      understand you at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to see you very much. I wanted your advice, as&mdash;as&mdash;a
      friend.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;Yes! you shall be my friend, in this at
      least. I can claim it&mdash;demand it. You had no right to&mdash;to&mdash;make
      me&mdash;trust you so much, and&mdash;and then&mdash;desert me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If any advice of mine&mdash;But I couldn't
      go through that sacrilegious farce of being near you and not&rdquo;&mdash;She
      waited breathlessly, a condensed eternity, for him to go on; but he
      stopped at that word, and added: &ldquo;How can I advise you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The disappointment was so cruel that the tears came into her eyes and ran
      down her face, which she averted from him. When she could control herself
      she said, &ldquo;I have an opportunity of going on in my profession now, in a
      way that makes me sure of success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad on your account. You must be glad to realize&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she retorted wildly. &ldquo;I am not glad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are conditions! He says he will go with me anywhere, and we can
      practise our profession together, and I can carry out all my plans. But
      first&mdash;first&mdash;he wants me to&mdash;marry him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know? Dr. Mulbridge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;I beg your pardon. I've no right to call him names.&rdquo; The young
      fellow halted, and looked at her downcast face. &ldquo;Well, do you want me to
      tell you to take him? That is too much. I did n't know you were cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me cruel! You leave me to be cruel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave you to be cruel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't play upon my words, if you won't ask me what I answered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I ask that? I have no right to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you shall know!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I told him that I had no plans. I have
      given them all up because&mdash;because I'm too weak for them, and because
      I abhor him, and because&mdash;But it was n't enough. He would not take
      what I said for answer, and he is coming again for an answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He is a man who believes that women may change, for reason or no
      reason; and&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you mean to take him when he comes back?&rdquo; gasped the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never! Not if he came a thousand times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what is it you want me to advise you about?&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; she answered, with freezing hauteur. She suddenly put up her
      arms across her eyes, with the beautiful, artless action of a
      shame-smitten child, and left her young figure in bewildering relief. &ldquo;Oh,
      don't you see that I love you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could n't you understand,&mdash;couldn't you see what I meant?&rdquo; she asked
      again that night, as they lost themselves on the long stretch of the
      moonlit beach. With his arm close about that lovely shape they would have
      seemed but one person to the inattentive observer, as they paced along in
      the white splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't risk anything. I had spoken, once for all. I always thought
      that for a man to offer himself twice was indelicate and unfair. I could
      never have done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's very sweet in you,&rdquo; she said; and perhaps she would have praised
      in the same terms the precisely opposite sentiment. &ldquo;It's some comfort,&rdquo;
       she added, with a deep-fetched sigh, &ldquo;to think I had to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;You didn't find it so easy to make love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, NOTHING is easy that men have to do!&rdquo; she answered, with passionate
      earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are moments of extreme concession, of magnanimous admission, that
      come but once in a lifetime.

    <h2>
      XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Mulbridge did not wait for the time he had fixed for his return. He
      may have judged that her tendency against him would strengthen by delay,
      or he may have yielded to his own impatience in coming the next day. He
      asked for Grace with his wonted abruptness, and waited for her coming in
      the little parlor of the hotel, walking up and down the floor, with his
      shaggy head bent forward, and his big hands clasped behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she hovered at the door before entering, she could watch him while he
      walked the whole room's length away, and she felt a pang at sight of him.
      If she could have believed that he loved her, she could not have faced
      him, but must have turned and run away; and even as it was she grieved for
      him. Such a man would not have made up his mind to this step without a
      deep motive, if not a deep feeling. Her heart had been softened so that
      she could not think of frustrating his ambition, if it were no better than
      that, without pity. One man had made her feel very kindly toward all other
      men; she wished in the tender confusion of the moment that she need not
      reject her importunate suitor, whose importunity even she could not
      resent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught sight of her as soon as he made his turn at the end of the room,
      and with a quick &ldquo;Ah, Ah!&rdquo; he hastened to meet her, with the smile in
      which there was certainly something attractive. &ldquo;You see I've come back a
      day sooner than I promised. I haven't the sort of turnout you've been used
      to, but I want you to drive with me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can't drive with you, Dr.
      Mulbridge,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, walk, then. I should prefer to walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me,&rdquo; she answered, and remained standing before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he bade her, and pushed up a chair towards her. His audacity,
      if it had been a finer courage, would have been splendid, and as it was
      she helplessly obeyed him, as if she were his patient, and must do so. &ldquo;If
      I were superstitious I should say that you receive me ominously,&rdquo; he said,
      fixing his gray eyes keenly upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do!&rdquo; she forced herself to reply. &ldquo;I wish you had not come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's explicit, at any rate. Have you thought it over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I had no need to do that, I had fully resolved when I spoke
      yesterday. Dr. Mulbridge, why didn't you spare me this? It's unkind of you
      to insist, after what I said. You know that I must hate to repeat it. I do
      value you so highly in some ways that I blame you for obliging me to hurt
      you&mdash;if it does hurt&mdash;by telling you again that I don't love
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew in a long breath, and set his teeth hard upon his lip. &ldquo;You may
      depend upon its hurting,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I was glad to risk the pain,
      whatever it was, for the chance of getting you to reconsider. I presume
      I'm not the conventional wooer. I'm too old for it, and I'm too blunt and
      plain a man. I've been thirty-five years making up my mind to ask you to
      marry me. You're the first woman, and you shall be the last. You couldn't
      suppose I was going to give you up for one no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for twenty! I can understand very well how you never thought of me in
      this way; but there's no reason why you shouldn't. Come, it's a matter
      that we can reason about, like anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I told you, it's something we can't reason about. Or yes, it is. I
      will reason with you. You say that you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you did n't love me, you would n't ask me to marry you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how can you expect me to marry you without loving you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't. All that I ask is that you won't refuse me. I know that you can
      love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I only want you to take time to try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't wish to try. If you persist, I must leave the room. We had better
      part. I was foolish to see you. But I thought&mdash;I was sorry&mdash;I
      hoped to make it less unkind to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of yourself, you were relenting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you pitied me, you did care for me a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I had the highest respect for you as a physician. I tell
      you that you were my ideal in that way, and I will tell you that if&rdquo;&mdash;she
      stopped, and he continued for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had not resolved to give it up, you might have done what I asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say that,&rdquo; she answered indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you give it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am not equal to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it? Who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have told me,&mdash;by every look and act of yours,&mdash;and I'm
      grateful to you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I told you now by word that you were fit for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't believe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would n't believe my word?&rdquo; She did not answer. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said
      presently, &ldquo;that you doubt me somehow as a man. What is it you think of
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't like to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will tell you. I think you are a tyrant, and that you want a
      slave, not a wife. You wish to be obeyed. You despise women. I don't mean
      their minds,&mdash;they 're despicable enough, in most cases, as men's
      are,&mdash;but their nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is news to me,&rdquo; he said, laughing. &ldquo;I never knew that I despised
      women's nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's true, whether you knew it or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I despise you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would, if you saw that I was afraid of you: Oh, why do you force me
      to say such things? Why don't you spare me&mdash;spare yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this cause I couldn't spare myself. I can't bear to give you up! I'm
      what I am, whatever you say; but with you, I could be whatever you would.
      I could show you that you are wrong if you gave me the chance. I know that
      I could make you happy. Listen to me a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's useless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! If you have taken the trouble to read me in this way, there must have
      been a time when you might have cared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There never was any such time. I read you from the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go away,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, in which she had risen, and
      began a retreat towards the door. &ldquo;But I will not&mdash;I cannot&mdash;give
      you up. I will see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. You shall not see me again. I will not submit to it. I will not
      be persecuted.&rdquo; She was trembling, and she knew that he saw her tremor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, with a smile that recognized her trepidation, &ldquo;I will not
      persecute you. I'll renounce these pretensions. But I'll ask you to see me
      once more, as a friend,&mdash;an acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are rather hard with me, I think,&rdquo; he urged gently. &ldquo;I don't think
      I'm playing the tyrant with you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are,&mdash;the baffled tyrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I promised not to offend again, why should you deny me your
      acquaintance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don't believe you.&rdquo; She was getting nearer the door, and as she
      put her hand behind her and touched the knob, the wild terror she had
      felt, lest he should reach it first and prevent her escape, left her. &ldquo;You
      are treating me like a child that does n't know its own mind, or has none
      to know. You are laughing at me&mdash;playing with me; you have shown me
      that you despise me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He actually laughed. &ldquo;Well, you've shown that you are not afraid of me.
      Why are you not afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she answered, and she dealt the blow now without pity, &ldquo;I'm
      engaged,&mdash;engaged to Mr. Libby!&rdquo; She whirled about and vanished
      through the door, ashamed, indignant, fearing that if she had not fled, he
      would somehow have found means to make his will prevail even yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood, stupefied, looking at the closed door, and he made a turn or two
      about the room before he summoned intelligence to quit it. When death
      itself comes, the sense of continuance is not at once broken in the
      survivors. In these moral deaths, which men survive in their own lives,
      there is no immediate consciousness of an end. For a while, habit and the
      automatic tendency of desire carry them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove back to Corbitant perched on the rickety seat of his rattling
      open buggy, and bowed forward as his wont was, his rounded shoulders
      bringing his chin well over the dashboard. As he passed down the long
      sandy street, toward the corner where his own house stood, the brooding
      group of loafers, waiting in Hackett's store for the distribution of the
      mail, watched him through the open door, and from under the boughs of the
      weatherbeaten poplar before it. Hackett had been cutting a pound of cheese
      out of the thick yellow disk before him, for the Widow Holman, and he
      stared at the street after Mulbridge passed, as if his mental eye had
      halted him there for the public consideration, while he leaned over the
      counter, and held by the point the long knife with which he had cut the
      cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see some the folks from over to Jocelyn's, yist'd'y,&rdquo; he said, in a
      spasm of sharp, crackling speech, &ldquo;and they seemed to think 't Mis'
      Mulbridge'd got to step round pretty spry 'f she did n't want another the
      same name in the house with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long silence followed, in which no one changed in any wise the posture
      in which he found himself when Hackett began to speak. Cap'n George Wray,
      tilted back against the wall in his chair, continued to stare at the
      store-keeper; Cap'n Jabez Wray, did not look up from whittling the chair
      between his legs; their cousin, Cap'n Wray Storrell, seated on a nailkeg
      near the stove, went on fretting the rust on the pipe with the end of a
      stiff, cast-off envelope; two other captains, more or less akin to them,
      continued their game of checkers; the Widow Seth Wray's boy rested
      immovable, with his chin and hand on the counter, where he had been trying
      since the Widow Holman went out to catch Hackett's eye and buy a
      corn-ball. Old Cap'n Billy Wray was the first to break the spell. He took
      his cigar from his mouth, and held it between his shaking thumb and
      forefinger, while he pursed his lips for speech. &ldquo;Jabez,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;did
      Cap'n Sam'l git that coalier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the whittler, cutting deeper into his chair, &ldquo;she did n't
      signal for him till she got into the channel, and then he'd got a couple
      o' passengers for Leyden; and Cap'n Jim brought her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Cap'n Billy, with a stiff yet tremulous reference of
      himself to the storekeeper, &ldquo;as spryness would help her, as long as he
      took the notion. I guess he's master of his own ship. Who's he going to
      marry? The grahs-widow got well enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. As I understand,&rdquo; crackled the store-keeper, &ldquo;her husband's turned
      up. Folks over there seem to think't he's got his eye on the other
      doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to marry with her, hey? Well, if either of 'em gets sick they won't
      have to go far for advice, and they won't have any doctor's bills to pay.
      Still, I shouldn't ha' picked out just that kind of a wife for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I understand,&rdquo; the storekeeper began; but here he caught sight of
      Widow Seth Wray's boy, and asked, &ldquo;What's wanted, Bub? Corn-ball?&rdquo; and
      turning to take that sweetmeat from the shelf behind him he added the rest
      in the mouth of the hollowly reverberating jar, &ldquo;She's got prop'ty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never knew a Mulbridge yet 't objected to prop'ty,&mdash;especially,
      other folks's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barlow he's tellin' round that she 's very fine appearin'.&rdquo; He handed the
      corn-ball to Widow Seth Wray's boy, who went noiselessly out on his bare
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cap'n Billy drew several long breaths. When another man might have been
      supposed to have dismissed the subject he said, &ldquo;Well, I never knew a
      Mulbridge that objected to good looks in women folks. They've all merried
      hahnsome wives, ever since the old gentleman set 'em the example with his
      second one. They got their own looks from the first. Well,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I
      hope she's a tough one. She's got either to bend or to break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say,&rdquo; said Cap'n George Wray, like one rising from the dead to say
      it, so dumb and motionless had he been till now, &ldquo;that Mis' Mulbridge was
      too much for the old doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about that,&rdquo; Cap'n Billy replied, &ldquo;but I guess her son's too
      much for her: she's only Gardiner, and he's Gardiner and Mulbridge both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one changed countenance, but a sense of Cap'n Billy's wit sparely yet
      satisfyingly glimmered from the eyes of Cap'n George and the storekeeper,
      and Cap'n Jabez closed his knife with a snap and looked up. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he
      suggested, &ldquo;she's seen enough of him to know beforehand that there would
      be too much of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never rightly understood,&rdquo; said Hackett, &ldquo;just what it was about him,
      there in the army&mdash;coming out a year beforehand, that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you never will,&mdash;from him,&rdquo; said Cap'n Jabez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laziness, I guess,&mdash;too much work,&rdquo; said old Cap'n Billy. &ldquo;What he
      wants is a wife with money. There ain't a better doctor anywhere. I've
      heard 't up to Boston, where he got his manifest, they thought everything
      of him. He's smart enough, but he's lazy, and he always was lazy, and
      harder'n a nut. He's a curious mixtur'. 'N' I guess he's been on the
      lookout for somethin' of this kind ever sence he begun practising among
      the summer boarders. Guess he's had an eye out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say he's poplar among 'em,&rdquo; observed the storekeeper thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's been pooty p'tic'lar, or they have,&rdquo; said Cap'n Jabez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, most on 'em's merried women,&rdquo; Hackett urged. &ldquo;It's astonishin' how
      they do come off and leave their husbands, the whole summer long. They say
      they're all out o' health, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said old Cap'n Billy, &ldquo;if them coaliers is goin' to make a
      settled thing of haulin' inside before they signal a pilot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know one thing,&rdquo; answered Cap'n Jabez, &ldquo;that if any coalier signals me
      in the channel, I'll see her in hell first&rdquo; He slipped his smooth, warm
      knife into his pocket, and walked out of the store amid a general silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's consid'ble worked up, about them coaliers,&rdquo; said old Cap'n Billy. &ldquo;I
      don't know as I've heard Jabez swear before&mdash;not since he was mate of
      the Gallatin. He used to swear then, consid'able.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them coaliers is enough to make any one swear,&rdquo; said Cap'n George. &ldquo;If
      it's any ways fair weather they won't take you outside, and they cut you
      down from twenty-five dollars to two dollars if they take you inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Cap'n Billy did not answer before he had breathed awhile, and then,
      having tried his cigar and found it out, he scraped a match on his
      coat-sleeve. He looked at the flame while it burned from blue to yellow.
      &ldquo;Well, I guess if anybody's been p'tic'lar, it's been him. There ain't any
      doubt but what he's got a takin' way with the women. They like him. He's
      masterful, and he ain't a fool, and women most gen'ly like a man that
      ain't a fool. I guess if he 's got his eye on the girl's prop'ty, she'll
      have to come along. He'd begin by havin' his own way about her answer;
      he'd hang on till she said Yes, if she did n't say it first-off; and he'd
      keep on as he'd begun. I guess if he wants her it's a match.&rdquo; And Cap'n
      Billy threw his own into the square box of tobacco-stained sawdust under
      the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maynard fully shared the opinion which rocked Dr. Mulbridge's defeat
      with a belief in his invincible will. When it became necessary, in the
      course of events which made Grace and Libby resolve upon a short
      engagement, to tell her that they were going to be married, she expressed
      a frank astonishment. &ldquo;Walter Libby!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Well, I am surprised.
      When I was talking to you the other day about getting married, of course I
      supposed it was going to be Dr. Mulbridge. I did n't want you to marry
      him, but I thought you were going to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why,&rdquo; demanded Grace, with mounting sensation, &ldquo;did you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I thought you would have to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you have such a weak will. Or I always thought you had. But perhaps
      it's only a weak will with other women. I don't know! But Walter Libby! I
      knew he was perfectly gone upon you, and I told you so at the beginning;
      but I never dreamt of your caring for him. Why, it seems too ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! I'm glad that it amuses you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, you're not, Grace. But you know what I mean. He seems so much
      younger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Younger? He's half a year older than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't say he was younger. But you're so very grave and he's so very
      light. Well, I always told Walter Libby I should get him a wife, but you
      were the last person I should have thought of. What's going to become of
      all your high purposes? You can't do anything with them when you're
      married! But you won't have any occasion for them, that's one comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not my idea of marriage that any high purpose will be lost in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is n't anybody's, before they get married. I had such high
      purposes I couldn't rest. I felt like hiring a hall, as George says, all
      the time. Walter Libby is n't going to let you practise, is he? You
      mustn't let him! I know he'd be willing to do anything you said, but a
      husband ought to be something more than a mere &amp; Co.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace laughed at the impudent cynicism of all this, for she was too happy
      to be vexed with any one just then. &ldquo;I'm glad you've come to think so well
      of husbands' rights at last, Louise,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maynard took the little puncture in good part. &ldquo;Oh, yes, George and I
      have had a good deal of light let in on us. I don't suppose my character
      was much changed outwardly in my sickness,&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not,&rdquo; answered Grace warmly. &ldquo;It was intensified, that was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maynard laughed in her turn, with real enjoyment of the conception.
      &ldquo;Well, I wasn't going to let on, unless it came to the worst; I did n't
      say much, but I kept up an awful thinking. It would have been easy enough
      to get a divorce, and George would n't have opposed it; but I looked at it
      in this way: that the divorce wouldn't have put us back where we were,
      anyway, as I had supposed it would. We had broken into each other's lives,
      and we couldn't get out again, with all the divorces under the sun. That's
      the worst of getting married: you break into each other's lives. You said
      something like it to me, that day when you came back from your sail with
      Walter Libby. And I just concluded that there could n't be any trial that
      would n't be a great deal easier to bear than getting rid of all your
      trials; and I just made up my mind that if any divorce was to be got,
      George Maynard might get it himself; a temporary separation was bad enough
      for me, and I told him so, about the first words I could speak. And we're
      going to try the new departure on that platform. We don't either of us
      suspect we can have things perfectly smooth, but we've agreed to rough it
      together when we can't. We've found out that we can't marry and then
      become single, any more than we could die and come to life again. And
      don't you forget it, Grace! You don't half know yourself, now. You know
      what you have been; but getting married lets loose all your possibilities.
      You don't know what a temper you've got, nor how badly you can behave&mdash;how
      much like a naughty, good-for-nothing little girl; for a husband and wife
      are just two children together: that's what makes the sweetness of it, and
      that's what makes the dreadfulness. Oh, you'll have need of all your good
      principles, I can tell you, and if you've a mind to do anything practical
      in the way of high purposes, I reckon there'll be use for them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another lady who was astonished at Grace's choice was more incurably
      disappointed and more grieved for the waste of those noble aims with which
      her worshipping fancy had endowed the girl even more richly than her own
      ambition. It was Grace's wish to pass a year in Europe before her husband
      should settle down in charge of his mills; and their engagement, marriage,
      and departure followed so swiftly upon one another, that Miss Gleason
      would have had no opportunity to proffer remonstrance or advice. She could
      only account for Grace's course on the theory that Dr. Mulbridge had
      failed to offer himself; but this explained her failure to marry him,
      without explaining her marriage with Mr. Libby. That remained for some
      time a mystery, for Miss Gleason firmly refused to believe that such a
      girl could be in love with a man so much her inferior: the conception
      disgraced not only her idol, but cast shame upon all other women, whose
      course in such matters is notoriously governed by motives of the highest
      sagacity and judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Breen hesitated between the duty of accompanying the young couple on
      their European travels, and that of going to the village where Libby's
      mills were situated,&mdash;in southern New Hampshire. She was not strongly
      urged to a decision by her children, and she finally chose the latter
      course. The mill property had been a long time abandoned before Libby's
      father bought it, and put it in a repair which he did not hasten to extend
      to the village. This had remained in a sort of picturesque neglect, which
      harmonized with the scenery of the wild little valley where it nestled;
      and Mrs. Breen found, upon the vigorous inquiry which she set on foot,
      that the operatives were deplorably destitute of culture and drainage. She
      at once devoted herself to the establishment of a circulating library and
      an enlightened system of cess-pools, to such an effect of ingratitude in
      her beneficiaries that she was quite ready to remand them to their former
      squalor when her son-in-law returned. But he found her work all so good
      that he mediated between her and the inhabitants, and adopted it with a
      hearty appreciation that went far to console her, and finally popularized
      it. In fact, he entered into the spirit of all practical reforms with an
      energy and intelligence that quite reconciled her to him. It was rather
      with Grace than with him that she had fault to find. She believed that the
      girl had returned from Europe materialized and corrupted; and she regarded
      the souvenirs of travel with which the house was filled as so many tokens
      of moral decay. It is undeniable that Grace seemed for a time, to have
      softened to, a certain degree of self-indulgence. During the brief opera
      season the first winter after her return, she spent a week in Boston; she
      often came to the city, and went to the theatres and the exhibitions of
      pictures. It was for some time Miss Gleason's opinion that these escapades
      were the struggles of a magnanimous nature, unequally mated, to forget
      itself. When they met she indulged the habit of regarding Mrs. Libby with
      eyes of latent pity, till one day she heard something that gave her more
      relief than she could ever have hoped for. This was the fact, perfectly
      ascertained by some summer sojourners in the neighborhood; that Mrs. Libby
      was turning her professional training to account by treating the sick
      children among her husband's operatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fall Miss Gleason saw her heroine at an exhibition of pictures. She
      rushed across the main hall of the Museum to greet her. &ldquo;Congratulate
      you!&rdquo; she deeply whispered, &ldquo;on realizing your dream! Now you are happy,
      now you can be at peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy? At peace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the good work you have taken up. Oh, nothing, under Gawd, is lost!&rdquo;
       she exclaimed, getting ready to run away, and speaking with her face
      turned over her shoulder towards Mrs. Libby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dream? Good work? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those factory children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mrs. Libby coldly, &ldquo;that was my husband's idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband's!&rdquo; cried Miss Gleason, facing about again, and trying to
      let a whole history of suddenly relieved anxiety speak in her eyes. &ldquo;How
      happy you make me! Do let me thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the effort to shake hands with Mrs. Libby she knocked the catalogue out
      of her hold, and vanished in the crowd without knowing it. Some gentleman
      picked it up, and gave it to her again, with a bow of burlesque devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Libby flushed tenderly. &ldquo;I might have known it would be you, Walter.
      Where did you spring from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been here ever since you came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, enjoying myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking at the pictures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watching you walk round:'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you couldn't be enjoying the pictures,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;I'm
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was not happy, indeed, in any of the aesthetic dissipations into which
      she had plunged, and it was doubtless from a shrewder knowledge of her
      nature than she had herself that her husband had proposed this active
      usefulness, which she once intended under such different conditions. At
      the end of the ends she was a Puritan; belated, misdated, if the reader
      will, and cast upon good works for the consolation which the Puritans
      formerly found in a creed. Riches and ease were sinful to her, and somehow
      to be atoned for; and she had no real love for anything that was not of an
      immediate humane and spiritual effect. Under the shelter of her husband's
      name the benevolent use of her skill was no queerer than the charity to
      which many ladies devote themselves; though they are neither of them
      people to have felt the anguish which comes from the fear of what other
      people will think. They go their way in life, and are probably not
      disturbed by any misgivings concerning them. It is thought, on one hand,
      that he is a man of excellent head, and of a heart so generous that his
      deference to her in certain matters is part of the devoted flattery which
      would spoil any other woman, but that she consults his judgment in every
      action of her life, and trusts his sense with the same completeness that
      she trusts his love. On the other hand, when it is felt that she ought to
      have done for the sake of woman what she could not do for herself, she is
      regarded as sacrificed in her marriage. If, it is feared, she is not
      infatuated with her husband, she is in a disgraceful subjection, without
      the hope of better or higher things. If she had children, they might be a
      compensation and refuge for her; in that case, to be sure, she must be cut
      off from her present resource in caring for the children of others; though
      the conditions under which she now exercises her skill certainly amount to
      begging the whole question of woman's fitness for the career she had
      chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both parties to this contention are, strange to say, ladies. If it has not
      been made clear from the events and characters of the foregoing history
      which opinion is right, I am unable to decide. It is well, perhaps, not to
      be too explicitly in the confidence of one's heroine. After her marriage
      perhaps it is not even decorous.

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

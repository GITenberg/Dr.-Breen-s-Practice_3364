description: "Dr. Breenâ€™s Practice is a novel, one of the earlier works by American\
  \ author and literary critic William Dean Howells. Houghton Mifflin originally published\
  \ the novel in 1881 in both Boston and New York. Howells wrote in the realist style,\
  \ creating a faithful representation of the commonplace, and in this case describing\
  \ everyday mannerisms that embody the daily lives of middle-class people.\n From\
